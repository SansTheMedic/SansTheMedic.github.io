<p>You may be wondering initially whether the gloo cannon could really be classified as a "movement mechanic",
    it does many other things after all, and it doesn't really fall in line with other things you'd think of as
    a weapon based movement mechanic, eg the famous rocket jump. But I'd argue that the definition of a movement
    mechanic is "a mechanic, intended or emergant, that gives the player(s) new options to get from point A to
    point B, either in a faster, easier, or otherwise different manner from base movement", and as the gloo cannon 
    is capable of letting the player do so, I feel it is worthy of the classification.
</p>

<p>I think that good, clever movement mechanics are always important. Well, not always, I doubt trimping (an
    emergant movement mechanic in team fortress 2 which abuses the poor source engine) in FNAF would improve the
    series, but whenever suitable. And while it's unfortunate that movement mechanics in games have been sort of
    stifled from what they used to be, I'm saving <i>that</i> part of the discussion on movement for a different
    article, so for now I'll sing the praises of the genius gloo cannon.
</p>

<p>If I had to think up the relation of the gloo cannon on the movement weapon family tree, it'd probably the love
    child of the portal gun and the rocket launcher. The gloo cannon does really feel like the rocket jump in the
    fact that it has alternate uses in combat, the trade of ammo for mobility, and the fact that it's not an instant
    movement but an abstract-ish pathway to the place you're trying to get. The portal gun relation comes from the
    fact that, well, the portal gun is from a puzzle game and requires you to be clever, and the gloo gun shares this 
    requirement of smarts. You have to think about what you're doing in order to get from A to B.
</p>

<p>The linking to the rocket launcher and portal gun was admittedly a little hamfisted sure, but it is still there in
    my eyes. But in truth, we don't really need to link them together, we just need to take the gloo cannon and put it
    up there with the other two, in the hall of great movement mechanics.
