<p>I've never been a fan of football, or any sport for that matter, but it is really interesting to see just how much
    work can go into development of a game, especially it's AI system. The sheer amount of things that the developers
    have done to ensure that their game is as accurate to the real world as possible is truly fascinating, going from
    simulating how some counties will have to pay more for the same player to some of the ever so slightly questionalbe
    schemes of Venezuela; and it really shows just how much the developers really care about getting their game as close
    to reality as possible.

<p>However it's also interesting to see what they have had to cut from the game to make the game enjoyable by the player
    at the cost of realism. The injury levels make sense to me, especially if the injuries are based on chances. It happens
    a lot in a lot of games, that sort of percentage fudging, simply due to how terrible humans are at judging probability:
    However the lack of inflation is not something I would have thought of. To be honest I probably wouldn't have thought to
    add inflation to the game at all so it should be taken with a slight grain of salt; but all the same, it's quite
    interesting that inflation would be such an issue for players due to how time is sped up in the game as it is for many
    other ones.
