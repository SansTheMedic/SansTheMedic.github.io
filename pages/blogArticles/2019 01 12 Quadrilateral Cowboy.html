<p>It's quite unfortunate to see just how much the developer had planned for the game but didn't manage to implement. They
    had a clear vision for how they wanted to to do the game at the start but they just couldn't quite get it to work. That
    being said a lot of the ideas do very much make sense as to why they couldn't be done. Sadly games don't often turn out
    how they're intended; but in a lot of cases that can be a good thing.
