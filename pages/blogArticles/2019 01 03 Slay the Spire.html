<p>I never really realized how disasterous an idea of luck based mechanics in a rogue like until now. Like, the idea that
    a dice is what's deciding victory or starting from the beginning is potentially horrid. That being said rogue likes do
    often have some levels of randomness at least in the style of their run generation. They have randomly generated rooms
    with randomly chosen enemies and items in; but the methodry of getting through those enemies and rooms shouldn't be
    decided by luck. So hiding what the enemy is gonna do in a situation like that is most certainly not very good.

<p>And sure, the options are being chosen before the player, but does it really matter when the player doesn't get to see
    what the options chosen are? Not really, it's still just as random luck as if it were chosen after. A player's decisions
    should, in a game where one single mistake results in not only dying but having to lose ALL progress, be decided as much
    by the player's skill as possible. And therefore the player should logically be given ALL the necessary info to do that
    as possible. Of course, that by no means should say that the player should know EVERYTHING; there should always be some
    stuff hidden under the veil to give the tension and suspense; but there should be enough info given to the player to
    let them understand, calculate, and strategize so they're never unfairly punished by what they would see as "luck".
