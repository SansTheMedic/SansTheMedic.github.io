<p>Chris Hunt feels very much like an agressive, angry DM running a campaign for his pen and paper RPG friends, making the
    world as horrid and inhospitable as he can to make his party die oout so he can move to doing something better with his
    life. But for Kenshi this works. The game is so utterly dark and inhospitable and post-apocalyptic, and does so better
    than a lot of other games trying to be post-apocalypse worlds. And part of that is because Kenshi creates it less
    through story or lore, and much more from how the player feels while playing. The game doesn't pull any punches with
    making the player feel like just another speck of doomed dust in the wastes, from the evil encounters like the tower
    of 100 cannibals to the combat system really making every attack and battle feel brutal, gritty, and messy.

<p>I can also imagine just how hard it was to make the world. 60 hand-crafted and fleshed out biomes that all had to fit
    together logically as well as mechanically, along with having settlements, encounters, and roads both for player and
    AI is a real endeavour. I mean, I can't even think of 60 biome types off the top of my head in general, let alone ones
    that would fit the world of Kenshi. 870 square kilometres is also an insane number, more than 23x the size of Bethesda's
    Skyrim, and the fact it was made by a team ranging in size from 6 people down to just Hunt himself is beyond crazy as a
    feat and I greatly applaud the creators for even just being insane enough to try it.

<p>Given Hunt's reasoning for his hatred of shops stocking based on the level of the player or some other arbitrary thing
    like that; I really can't help but agree with the man. It makes a lot of sense really, humans are always looking at
    things they wish they had (like a 150 quid 1/8 scale statue of BAR from GFL which I REALLY want). It's often the motive
    of theives and robbers, they want it and can't pay for it so they just take it. It's an amazing way to motivate the
    player, making them go "oh that sword looks fuckin DOPE! Oh what?! That's so expensive! Welp, I guess I better get 
    working".
