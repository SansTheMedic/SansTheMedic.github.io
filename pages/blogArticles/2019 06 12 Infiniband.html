<p>This tech looks quite promising in all actuality; all the faster server speeds meaning that, in the world of gaming at
    the very least, allow for much faster gameplay speeds, massive downsizes in ping and lag (hopefully), and servers being
    able to handle bigger playerbases at once. The tech is new and complex, so I don't know all the details; but it's quite
    clear it's gonna end up being a BIG thing.
