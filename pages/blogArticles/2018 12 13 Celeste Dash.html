<p>Any action that makes the character faster than normal automatically makes the character harder for the player to deal
    with simply with how they have less time to process things. And especially with the mechanic where the player has no
    control for the first few seconds it can become quite frustrating. That being said it's clear that the developers put
    a MASSIVE amount of work into making it fair and balanced to allow casual players to feel in control at all times, with
    things like the Kyote jump and the minor course corrections.

<p>That being said, Celeste has always felt like it's been designed more for speedrunners than the casual player, and what
    is definite is that the devs put a LOT of work into making the game speedrunner friendly. I personally feel like it makes
    all the stuff they did to make dash feel good even more important than if they were designing with casual players as
    the focus. And they most certainly did well. I remember watching a speedrun of Celeste from GDQ (I forget if it was an
    AGDQ or SGDQ  event) and it was so hypnotising to watch simply from how well it controlled.
