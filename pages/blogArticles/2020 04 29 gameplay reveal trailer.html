<p>For once this is actually a post not based on response or thoughts to another article or a youtube video,
    but instead based on a conversation I had with a friend the other day. The friend (who shall be named
    Julia to preserve her privacy and real name) brought to my attention the "official gameplay reveal" of
    Nier: Reincarnation.
</p>

<p>Now, I've never been a fan of the Nier franchise. That's not to say I dislike it, but more just... It never
    managed to get me interested in it. As such, maybe my opinions on the trailer have bias due to it (or maybe
    my lack of real interest or connection with the franchise gives me a more unbiased opinion, who knows) but
    I found the trailer to show the game in a less than stellar light.
</p>

<p>The gameplay reveal trailer for the mobile game consists of 1 minute of a young girl, the seeming main character
    and her little ghost companion (like the Weiss in Nier and Pod in Automata, according to Julia) running through
    an abandoned and ruined city, reminding me much of Journey's setting, with the only controls in sight being a
    single joystick control for movement. It appears from the gameplay reveal that the game will be a walking sim.
</p>

<p>I'll leave the discussion on walking sims for another time, it may make a good future topic, but I'll quickly
    sum my thoughts on the matter up as "if your game's only interaction is basic movement mechanics, you might as
    well write it as a book or make it a movie". That summary is a little lackluster in places, my definition of basic
    movement mechanics is a little vague due to me not knowing a quick and simple way to explain it, but the point
    stands that I'm hoping that Nier Reincarnation has more mechanics to it than what was showcased in the trailer.
</p>

<p>But here comes the meat of the topic on hand, if there is more to the gameplay, why is this titled the gameplay reveal?</p>

<p>According to Julia, a gameplay trailer only means that it has gameplay in it, but I personally think that that's
    a bad classification. In my eyes, a gameplay trailer, and especially a gameplay <i>reveal</i> trailer, should showcase
    the gameplay. And if you want to make a trailer that reveals the gameplay, wouldn't you show the more interesting and
    unique mechanics and gameplay, not just a minute long segment of walking.
</p>

<p>Julia had raised the counterpoint that the trailer's goal was to raise interest and get people curious, which in the trailer's
    defense it most certainly does well as I found even myself mildly curious, but then why call it a gameplay reveal trailer?
    Surely a better terminology would be a teaser trailer or just a reveal trailer?
</p>

<p>The trailer is by no means bad, but I just feel it to be misclassified, though even then I am unsure. Perhaps it is something
    to think a little more about...
