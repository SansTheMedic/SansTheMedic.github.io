<p>While the mechanics and processes used for creating the sounds don't massively affect me; the idea's behind the design
    of them are really interesting. I was particularly interested by how they were trying to tell a story of the experience
    using the sound design; and all the ways that they try to get the sounds to subtly and unconsciously inform and guide
    the player is truly interesting. One thing that I definitely find sticks out is the sound of the flatline; which While
    drowned out mostly by other sounds still creates a sense of dread much like a flatline does naturally. There isn't
    much I can say about this as sound design isn't really a feild that I'll have much work in nor have any real experience
    in at the moment, but it is certainly quite interesting!
