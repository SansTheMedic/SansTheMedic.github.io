    It's amazing to see how such simple instructions can create such complex, mesmerising patterns, and it opened my eyes
    to the beauty of emergant behaviour. It is very much a slightly more complex Conway's, which is something that had
    interested me greatly for a very long period of my life, and the way that it and emergant behaviour in general can
    create beautiful complexity from beautiful simplicity is... Well... Beautiful.
