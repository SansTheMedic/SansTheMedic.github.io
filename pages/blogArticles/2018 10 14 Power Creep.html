<p>Power creep is dangerous, man. Very dangerous. The fact that it is incredibly hard to avoid doing accidentally coupled
    with the damage it can easily do to a playerbase - especially for genres like Collectibe Card Games and MOBAs where
    it is very stat based so creep can very easily set in. That doesn't even take into account the fact that many of the
    big, consumer-unfriendly companies like EA could easily see power creep as easy monetisation (In fact some times they
    already do have that issue for example with EA's battlefront 2 and the heroes that were practically locked behind pay
    walls).

<p>The idea of incomperables is certainly one that works, and is most certainly used in MOBA games. However it isn't perfect
    by any means as not only can it drastically increase costs like Extra Credits mentioned, but it can also make things very
    hard to balance. Overwatch by Blizzard has had balance issues for quite some time but none of it comes from power creep;
    instead it's just from poor balancing of the incomperables, which in this case are the heroes. Now is a large part probably
    just fans whining? Perhaps, but there most certainly noticably big issues with some heroes; such as Bastion and how he had
    been an issue for a long time.

<p>The artificial keeping in check is definitely another interesting solution; the Type 2/standard approach taken by Magic
    the gathering especially. I also know that Blizzard's hearthstone does this with it's standard pool. In hearthstone, only
    cards from the latest few updates along with most the original base cards in the standard and ranked play. They don't
    really put cards back in from old sets - at least from what I know - but they do have wild mode which means you still
    are perfectly able to use cards that have fallen from the standard pool. I do feel like Hearthstone should create a wild
    ranked as well as a way to buy packs of cards from update pools that are no longer in standard, but that is really not
    a vital thing.

<p>The legacy way that Everquest used feel a little less useful however; it doesn't feel like it's solving the issue and
    more just delaying it... Perhaps if I had played the game and understood how exactly Legacy worked I'd be able to see
    it in a way that made it sound more successful an answer
