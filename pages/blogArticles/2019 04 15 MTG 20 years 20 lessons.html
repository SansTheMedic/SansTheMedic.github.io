<p>The talk was done about a card game but the lessons can and should be applied to all of game design. This goes especially
    for the ones that directly work with the player's emotional connection with the game. Things like players falling in
    love with the game because of the little details are shown time and time again. Massive examples of this are things like
    Undertale where even the minor monsters are deeply beloved by fans because they're all unique; Pokemon where both trainers
    and the pokemon themselves are always beloved be them major and famous or the little random encounter you find on the
    journey; and many many gatcha games such as GFL where the selling point IS the cast of minor characters that don't
    feature in the main story but are there for YOU to put into your own stories!
</p>

<p>Many of the lessons highlight that games are supposed to be experiences for the player; and that the player therefore
    should be able to have their experience be personal. Things like player customisation is such a massive staple in games
    because of this; be it mechanical customisation like skill trees or weapon upgrades OR completely cosmetic. These
    lessons also highlight that it is better to be terrible than mediocre. It's always better to be an extremely challenging
    game that's almost too hard - for example the old SNES game Ghosts n Goblins - than something that's easy and ultimately
    boring like how Xcom2 can get in the late game.

<p>Here's a quick list of all the rules (minus rule 20 that just says they're all connected):</p>

<ol type="1">
    <li>Fighting against the player is dumb</li>
    <li>Aesthetic consistency matters</li>
    <li>It's important to resonate with pre-created emotional responses</li>
    <li>Design should try to aid understanding of gameplay & players don't need to be taught things design obviously shows (eg red barrel = explosive)</li>
    <li>Interesting != fun</li>
    <li>mechanics built around the feelings you want your player to feel</li>
    <li>Try to let the player make choices that allows them to make their game personal and gain an emotional connection to their build</li>
    <li>The details and little things are what make the player fall in love with the game. often little characters</li>
    <li>Players will almost always appreciate customisation and personalization.</li>
    <li>Always give room for players to explore when possible</li>
    <li>Don't worry about evoking strong negative response, worry about not revoking strong responses at all</li>
    <li>Don't design to prove they can do something</li>
    <li>Make the fun and the correct bits the same</li>
    <li>Sometimes show don't tell doesn't work, and you need to be blunt</li>
    <li>Design components for the part of the playerbase it's made for</li>
    <li>Be more afraid of boredom than challenge</li>
    <li>You don't have to change much to create a new experience</li>
    <li>Restrictions breed creativity</li>
    <li>Players are very good at seeing what's wrong and finding problems; but they're bad at solving them</li>
</ol>
