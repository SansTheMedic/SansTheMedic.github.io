<p>By god is the idea of trying to make a similar level of depth to chess quite the undertaking. Part of me honestly
    almost feels bad for the guy, it must be a really tough time. Even still, it's quite honestly interesting to see how
    he had been toying with the idea of character traits for so long. I can see how he'd think that it would be too
    complicated for the game at first, and the fact that it was MOBAs like Dota and LoL that made him change his mind
    is also interesting based on how they are such different games from Spy party.

<p>It's definitely a struggle to figure out how to properly get the play to ease into complexity and get them to "read the
    book" over time, but I can see that it's also an incredibly important one to get right otherwise the player may either
    not get to the high level play the developer wants or give up early in the game due to complexity. Similarly on the
    theme of the player's experience, I think the idea that the spy wants to play the underdog makes a lot of sense. After
    all, in a lot of other games with spy ideas such as "The hidden" or just the spy class in Team fortress 2 have those
    senses of you being outnumbered and outgunned and just having to use your wits and better information to succeed. In
    that sense, it's actually really fun to be the spy.
