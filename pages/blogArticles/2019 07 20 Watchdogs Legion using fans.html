<p>I personally feel like in this instance the community is taking the commonality of anti-consumer business practices by
    big companies, but misattributing it to Ubi here. In my eye this seems like they're just trying to celebrate their fans
    instead of trying to save a bit of money and misuse their fanbase. They've already done similar with their Tials series'
    newest title, "Trials rising" by getting youtube rapper/musician Dan Bull to create a song that was put in the game; so
    this just feels like they're doing the same thing on a larger scale. It feels like they're making a mountain out of a
    molehill and overthinking what Ubi is trying to do, which is kinda unfortunate really...
