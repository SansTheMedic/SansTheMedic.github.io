<h3>READ PART 1 FIRST, IT'S THE PREVIOUS ARTICLE.
</h3>

<p>Alright, if you've read the previous article there shouldn't be any need to delay; let's get right into
    it. Battletech takes all the problems I mentioned with Warhammer and does them all right.
</p>

<p>We'll skip over the whole fanwork controversy real quick because the fact Battletech has yet to do that
    is all you really need to point out that yeah, they do it right; and move on to the model extortion.
    This is the only real thing I have to say there is a caveat to, because while Battletech models aren't
    nearly as costly (the Â£500 minimum it'd take to buy as single army at cheapest for 40k you can basically
    get EVERY MODEL set released for Battletech with), it's offset by the models being MUCH harder to get.
    CGL is a much smaller company than GW, so they can't exactly afford to sell all of their models individually
    and stuff (well they probably could, they just don't), so you either have to get premade boxsets of 4-5
    mechs (where if you're VERY lucky they're all mechs you actually want) or buy grab bag boxes to get random
    mechs.
</p>

<p>HOWEVER, the reason that this isn't as bad as it sounds (except for for me because I want to paint specific
    models dammit) is because unlike GW, CGL <i>actively endorses</i> proxies. Whether you use official plastic,
    third party, 3d printed, cardboard cutouts (which they also sell and iirc come with most offical source books),
    or even completely random objects as long as they have a defined front and both players agree what is what;
    everything is allowed for battletech!
</p>

<p>Next up, rule book costs... You only have to buy the basic rules, and even then you don't really
    because they're easy to find online. Yep, that's it. "but what about the faction specific rules and
    stat blocks?", I hear you ask. There aren't any faction specific rules, everything is equal across the
    board (except for clans but fuck clans) and stat blocks are universal and easy to find. This also means
    that everything is at least decently well balanced, again except for the clans but clan tech while better
    is also far more expensive and we've dealt with them for decades now so its fine, and rules aren't
    constantly updating every few months. The army you made in 2007 will be just as viable in 2027.
</p>

<p>Another beautiful thing about Battletech's rules and stat blocks is that you can actually make custom
    units with the official rules! Because everything about a unit from engines to armor to weapons have
    associated weights, costs, and "slots" (the space you can fill within a unit) attached to them, you
    can quite literally make whatever you desire and, as long as you aren't cheating, it'll be tournament
    legal! I have plenty of designs I've made myself; from Nightstars with all the cool fancy Star League
    era tech stripped out so they can work in the primitive succession war era; to speedy wheeled tanks
    that I modelled after the WW2 Crusader tank series; to a massive 100 ton behemoth based on a drawing
    a friend of mine made! Now creating a new unit by hand will be kind of difficult, which is why...
</p>

<p>I next bring up Megamek, the Battletech counterpart to 40k's battlescribe. Megamek not only has the
    stat block for every official unit (and even some unofficial ones); but it also is a fully functional
    online multiplayer game for allowing you to run actual tabletop battles; has a built in side app called
    MekHQ that allows you to manage and run entire campaigns and stuff; AND has another built in side app
    called MegaMekLab which lets you make all sort of custom units of your own! I use it constantly myself.
    And, pray tell, what do Catalyst Game Labs think of Megamek? Do they actively try to give it the axe
    because it not only cuts into rulebook sales but also allows people to play their game for free on a
    third party tool? Nope! They actively <i>help the megamek team update their system</i>.
</p>

<p>Catalyst game labs does everything GW does wrong, right. They don't care about pure profit and instead
    about making their fans happy and making something for people to enjoy, because they are smart enough
    to understand that cultivating a loyal and loving audience is by far the best way to make money in this
    industry. And that is why Catalyst Game Labs deserves Games Workshop's throne.
