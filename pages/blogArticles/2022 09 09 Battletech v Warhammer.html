<p>I suppose some groundwork should be done for those few who have somehow never heard of
    Warhammer, and for the probably somewhat larger number who have never heard of Battletech.
    Warhammer is a series of 2 - technically 3 - table top wargames greated by Games Workshop (GW),
    a company that became famous thanks to their flagship franchise. There are two main forms of
    Warhammer: Warhammer Fantasy, or Age of Sigmar as it is called post rebranding; and Warhammer
    40000, or 40k for short.
</p>

<p>Battletech, meanwhile, is also a tabletop wargame originally created by FASA Corporation, but
    has since traded hands multiple times with the current owners being Catalyst Game Labs. It only
    has a sci-fi version, and unlike warhammer which focuses more on infantry scale combat with the
    occasional addition of armored assets and VERY rarely big stompy robots: Battletech is all about
    those big stompy robots! Well, it's about combined arms warfare in general really: mechs, tanks,
    aerospace assets, and even infantry - though whole platoons as single units unlike 40k which is
    more squad by squad.

</div>

<p>Now that the groundwork has been laid out, we can begin to discuss what this article is about: 
    the bullshit that is how awful GW treats its customer base compared to Catalyst. As you may have
    seen if you keep up with the current events of the tabletop scene, about a year ago a MASSIVE
    exodus of players who were previous loyal 40k fans started to jump ship, rivalling the exodus
    of World of Warcraft players the year prior. Why was this? Well, a variety of reasons really.
</p>

<p> The first and most pressing of the time at which the exodus happened was the recent... "change 
    in plan" GW had for how it would handle the creators of fan content. See, GW wanted to make a
    warhammer themed streaming site ala Disney+, but without official shows or movies to exactly put
    on there (1-0 to Battletech already, since they DID have an official animated series release in
    1994 which has since been retconned to being "canon" but as a propaganda cartoon for one of the
    in setting factions this is not a joke this really is the case), GW had to turn to the fan made
    community works instead.
</p>

<p>Around that same time, the community aclaimed Astartes miniseries came out, a short series of
    3d animations rivalling the quality of what entire triple A companies could put out and made by
    a SINGLE MAN. It quite literally blew the warhammer community away and they were hooked on its
    continuation... Until GW bought the creator out and forced him to work only for their paid
    subscription service, and released an official statement BANNING third party fan animations and
    the like. Not only was Astartes kidnapped, but other famous series like "If the Emperor had a
    Text to Speech Device" - an absolutely hilarious comedy series set in the 40k universe - was
    murdered by the people who owned this previously beloved IP.
</p>

<p>It should go without saying that this was a massive PR disaster and one of the main contributing
    factors of the exodus; but there are several other things that GW does that sucked and I will
    list off now for the sake of coming back later for an amazing payoff. Ask any warhammer fan about
    the cost of their armies and they will lament about the frankly extortionate nature of the GW
    plastic tax. Any model for Warhammer costs about double it should (and often does when talking
    about models you can directly compare to other generic models eg skeletons), the issue is even
    worse outside of the UK. I can quite literally get a full 1/350 scale battleship model of the
    Bismarck for the same price as a SINGLE tank for 40k. There are space marine models (space marines,
    being the poster boys of 40k, suffer the plastic tax the worst) that are <b>Â£21</b> for a
    <b>single</b> miniature. Not pre-made or pre-painted, mind, you still have to do that all yourself.
</p>

<p>Perhaps you might be saying "well that's not such a big deal, if skeletons from GW cost twice as
    much as third party, just buy third party plastic!". You can't, at least not if you want to go
    into the competetive scene. Warhammer outright BANS the use of proxy, third party, or 3d printed
    models. It hurts their profit margin, see?
</p>

<p>additionally, there is the nature of balance in warhammer. Codex-creep is a thing that exists
    and it is bad. See, how 40k rules come out is through codexes. Big books you have to buy that
    give the basic rules of the game OR the stat blocks and specific rulings of your faction. That's
    right, you have to buy two books to be able to play a single army. Not to mention more if you
    want to use specific units they release between codexes for that faction! Codexes are also
    attrociously paced and balanced. Typically whatever the most recent codexes are will be the
    strongest armies currently; and some factions get codexes SEVERAL times in the space it takes
    for other factions to get a single update (again, I'm looking at you space marines). And again
    just like with the models, you can't use proxies. There is an online app called Battlescribe which
    tries its best to give free and easy access to the stat blocks of units, not even faction rules
    just the stat blocks. GW has been trying to kill battlescribe for YEARS now.
</p>

<p>All in all, GW is a terrible company for how utterly anti-consumerist they've become, and because
    I've made this article I have a feeling I'm never going to be able to work for them am I. Still,
    this article isn't just about 40k! It's about battletech too, so let's go over all that battletech
    does right in comparrison.... In the next article I feel like this one has gone on way too long
    already and I feel bad about having a single article take any longer to read than it already does
    so I'm splitting this into two.
