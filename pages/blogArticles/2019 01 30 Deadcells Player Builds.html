<p>One quote that really rings true about this article is "the idea of the way we want it to be played, and the efficient 
    way is usually the opposite". Because that is quite true. A similar place that was definitely shown was with Xcom EU,
    where the game was supposed to be full of risk taking but was plagued by players overwatch camping and going at a
    snail's pace. It can be quite hard to figure out how to coax the player into wanting to play the way you intend, but
    it is also a very necessarry one.

<p>The varied playstyle is already encouraged by rogue likes but it is most certainly the case that it will be hard for
    developers to really get the player mixing it up each run. The wide array of weapons do help but at the same time it's
    still hard for the developer to get them balanced all right and not make one style simply better, much like how the dual
    bows used to be. It is good to see how they managed to fix it while still making dual bows viable, and it's good to see
    they are continuing to tune the experience so it is right for the play to play the game as it was made to be played.
