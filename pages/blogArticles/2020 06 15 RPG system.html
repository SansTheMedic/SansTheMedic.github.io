<p>These courses were a lot of fun to do in all, and I hold a lot of respect for Rick
    and Sam for designing fun and engaging courses.
</p>

<p>That being said, I have to say that the combat course was a lot more fun to do than
    the inventory system, partly due to the greater level of engagement. GameDevTV does
    something that none of the other courses I've done before do, and that was add a lot
    of tasks that help build skills and reinforce the knowledge. Every lecture has a
    challenge in it that involves what we did, sometimes it's to complete the goal of the
    lecture after being given the needed information, sometimes it's to make something of
    your own using the systems introduced, and sometimes it's a mix of the two. There were
    also - at least for the combat course - quizzes at intervals in the course that made
    sure you were retaining the knowledge that was learned. Sadly the inventory system one
    didn't have any of these quizzes and was much less interractive in general.
</p>

<p>I understand why that is, and they explain it at the very start. The Combat course is largely
    a more entry level course, so they go through it step by step and write the code basically
    alongside you. The Inventory course however is more intermediate, so they don't bore the
    students with coding stuff they already know how to and simply explain the code that they
    are making. Unfortunately, at least for me, that ended up being sort of boring in it's own
    right, and I would have much prefered a more step-by-step course where we developed it together.

<p>Still, if nothing else I've learned this: I am terrible at making maps in games.</p>
