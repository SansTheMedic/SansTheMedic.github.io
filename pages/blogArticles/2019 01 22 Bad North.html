<p>Pikes are most certainly an interesting sight in a game, as a lot of the time many games that aren't directly trying
    to be realistic medivial simulator include them. If nothing else, people would lump them into spears and not think
    about the whole range of polearms in existance from spears to pikes to glaives. It's extra interesting when you
    consider that there is such a small number  of weapons being chosen to be added to the game, and they took pikes
    over axes or other better known weapons, though the reasoning of trying to break away from the norm is understandable.

<p>I also greatly understand the pain in tuning the stats of the pikemen. We had similar issues with the resources in
    our printer simulator for the gamejam, getting all the timings and speeds actually right to make the experience correct.
    Though in Bad North it was definitely more important as it would either make pikemen overwhelmingly OP or completely
    useless.

<p>On top of all of that, the sheer amount of work that went into making the game's soldiers feel like actual people is
    both surprising and actually not; realism can take a hell of a lot of work after all.
