<p>This is incredibly interesting and thought provoking for a system and I'm surprised that it isn't
    already commonly used. I mean, the borderlands series is the only one that I can genuinely think
    of that uses random generation for a chunk of it's content; with it's famous gun generators. And
    the thing is, sandbox games like minecraft can gain much more in the ways of content by doing the
    exact same basic property randomization; since they are capable of having random biomes, monsters,
    and even dimensions like Jay mentions.
</p>

<p>I personally am not sure that the whole locking the generated content behind alternate dimensions
    thing is a good idea, and think the sliders option is the best choice; but that's just me.
</p>

<p>I do, however, see one issue that may arise from this; and that is for multiplayer servers like
    Hypixel or MC Central. These servers may have to take extra measures to ensure that random content
    didn't break anything in their created games. And one easy option would be for them to create the
    worlds with the RNG content slider set to no random content; but at the same time they may want
    to use randomised content for their games as they might have found some that gave really useful
    effects.
</p>

<p>To that regard I would suggest also implementing a way that players could access the tools the game
    used to randomly generate content upon world creation; so they could add their own ores, mobs,
    biomes, etc to the world to sit along side the content already in the base game or randomly generated.
