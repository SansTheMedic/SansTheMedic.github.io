    Recently I've found a little bit of a hyperfixation on the games <i>Lobotomy Corporation</i> and <i>Library of Ruina</i>, by
    Korean developer <i>Project Moon</i>, not to be confused with <i>TYPE Moon</i> who create the FATE series. The games have a
    really interesting setting and compelling story, unique characters, complex and nuanced gameplay, and so much love put in by
    the developers. Project Moon has even made an honest to god CAFE in REAL LIFE that is themed around their series (it's called
    HamHam PangPang, it's in Suwon, and is advertised in Library of Ruina as a joke).

    However one thing that Project Moon don't do quite so well, at least for Library of Ruina, it's balancing. Now specifically
    this really is only for Library of Ruina, Lobotomy Corp's balancing is by and large on point. The challenges are challenging,
    there's a very understandable curve in difficulty (though some members of a difficulty class are more of a pain than others),
    and while some bits of equipment are certainly more worth it than others, because of the mechanics of the game that is entirely
    acceptable. They even have a few bits of balancing that are subtle and would have been easily overlooked by other developers,
    but are actually incredibly clever at balancing.

    Library of Ruina on the other hand has had lackluster balancing for a while in it's development. Underpowered cards, overpowered 
    cards, the same two things for abnormalities (minibosses). But the one I want to discuss today is what I feel is one of the bigger
    improperly balanced parts of the game, ranged combat pages. Notably, that they suck.
