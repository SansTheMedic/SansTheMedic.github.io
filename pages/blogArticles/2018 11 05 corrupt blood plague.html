<p>The idea of players actually acting like this were a real epedemic is truly interesting and offers quite a lot of potential
    for big name MMO titles to work with epedemiologists to better research human behaviour during situations like this
    as well as for scenarios that could occur within those situations for example how people would react to the government
    - or admins within the game to create a parallel for the game world - acting in certain ways
</p>

<p>Of course there are always factors that are gonna cause issues with how valuable and accurate the data is. There are
    always going to be players that don't act like it was real, either just not acting as they would do normally or actively
    trying to spread whatever model plague there was; and things like respawning will also always be problematic. Still, it
    does offer some interesting possibilities and much like theteam at Extra Credits, I too am quite interested in seeing
    MMOs and researchers team up to see what they can make happen for the benefits of science and humanity.

<p> Who knows, maybe even the Corrupt Blood Plague wasn't a glitch after all?</p>
