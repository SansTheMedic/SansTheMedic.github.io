<p>The google stadia shows an extremely large amount of promise for game streaming, and if it goes well it will utterly
    revolutionise the future of gaming. It will certainly be a massive blow to the era of console gaming and potentially
    to portable consoles like the switch as well, since you would be able to play games not only practically where you want
    like with the switch, but also on practically whatever you want too.

<p>That being said there are a few things that do worry me about this whole cloud gaming thing in general. For one, I am
     not entirely sure how cloud gaming will get around screens that don't quite have that great a quality; which may make
    bigger games an issue to play even if all the GPU calculations are done by the server. The fact that Stadia only supports 
    the new Pixel 3 and 3a seems to be a bit of a at least temporary fix from Google; however that could end up hurting Stadia
    and there is also the fact that Microsoft's attempt at cloud gaming, xCloud, doesn't have such limitations. It will be
    very interesting to see how Microsoft and indeed any other company that works on cloud gaming will solve this potential issue.
</p>

<p>The other real issue I forsee for cloud gaming is that on mobile, reception and wifi are often not very reliable to stay
    in one state for long, at least in my experience, so there is good likelyhood that there could be issues with dips in
    connection that may frequently boot gamers out of the service. I can see this being a massive problem if not addressed,
    so I hope google, Microsoft, and any other cloud gaming developers can solve it.

<p>There is of course debate over whether Stadia or xCloud will be better, because of course there is. From my point of view
    it is rather too early to judge as we don't know all the information over xCloud and we also don't know if either will
    succeed or if cloud gaming will die as suddenly as it was brought into life. It will be an interesting two months this
    October and November; with xCloud having a public test on the former and Stadia being slated for full launch on the latter;
    and the only thing to do now is wait with ever-so-slighyly baited breath to see what becomes of this innovative and possibly
    scene-shattering new prospect.
