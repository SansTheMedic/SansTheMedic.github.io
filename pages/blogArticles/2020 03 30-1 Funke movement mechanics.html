<p>I've watched this video several times in the past, and only this time have I realized something that I previously hadn't.
    I realized that Funke actually saw Overwatch's method of neutering movement as successful. I still have a feeling he
    dislikes it, as he claimed to be an avid supporter of movement mechanics and his mention of how overwatch just removed
    the trick with genji feel like it'd be a critisism (I don't see why someone would really defend that in my opinion), but
    I can begrudgingly see that he is right to say that it is a way to succeed with a movement shooter.
</p>

<p>Doesn't mean I like it though.</p>

<p>It is a real shame that movement mechanics have sort of died off in modern times, at least as they were in the old days.
    That of course isn't to say nobody uses them anymore, of course, just that the big AAA companies don't seem bothered with
    making those sorts of high skill mechanics in their multiplayer. The last big AAA multiplayer movement shooter I can really
    think of was Black Ops 3 and to an extent Infinite Warfare. The thrust jump mechanic was actually really good and did lend
    itself to some creative movement, someone had made a mod that added it to Gmod and I found it really fun to use, but past that
    I can't really think of any complex movement mechanics.
</p>

<p>And hell, I'd accept the merging of the skill gap in things like rocketjumping becoming a single button in overwatch if they
    didn't <i>purposefully remove emergant mechanics because it has a high skill floor</i>. I think emergant mechanics are near
    vital for high skill games, especially ones where you're trying to bring in new players with an easy start. A massively good
    example are the emergant mechanics for movement in Team Fortress two. Rocket jumping and sticky jumping were intended mechanics
    (though even they have the skill floor of emergant ones due to their origin and how Valve implemented them) but there's also
    sentry jumping, damage surfing, trimping, and likely multiple others I don't even know about. Don't remove things because new
    players will find it hard, embrace them, because then it gives reason for your players to get invested.
</p>

<p>And to end on a lighter note, <i>does</i> noclipping count as a movement mechanic? Well given my definition last article, "a 
    mechanic, intended or emergant, that gives the player(s) new options to get from point A to point B, either in a faster, easier, 
    or otherwise different manner from base movement", I suppose it is.</p>
