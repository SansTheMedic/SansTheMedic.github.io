<p>The IDGA 2020 ejam was an experience and a half for me. It wasn't my first rodeo, sure, but it
    was the shortest I'd ever done (all the previous ones were week long ones) and it was the first
    where I was going in... Well, not alone, but without people I really knew.
</p>

<p>See, the IDGA jams are for novices and newbies to game development; students primarily. So unlike
    all the other times where I had my dad, a veteran programmer, to help me out, I was instead with
    a group of 4 strangers. We had a Frenchman, a spaniard, a finnish person, and an american, alongside
    me.
</p>

<p>We had spent a little time trying to decide on what we were gonna do, but we couldn't really think
    of anything, deciding maybe it was better to wait until the theme of the jam - "celebration" - was
    announced an hour before it began. <i>That</i> was our fatal mistake, and the thing I've really
    taken away from this.
</p>

<p>For all our week long jams, me and my dad typically took the first of the seven days to decide what
    it was we were gonna make. That is typically reasonably fine for a week long jam. However for a 48hr
    jam, you need to figure out your idea FAST, preferrably before the jam even starts. In the end by the
    time we had decided what we were gonna do and more importantly how we were gonna do it, we had already
    burned over a quarter of the time we had for the jam.
</p>

<p>On the first day, when I had gone downstairs to make myself some lunch, I had a chat with my dad about how
    the jam was going. He mentioned to me that the game jam themes can sometimes be quite tentative if you want.
    He specifically used the example of "you could make a scifi horror shooter where the weapon you use is called
    Celebration, and you should be fine". If only I had known that before we had sunk so long trying to figure out
    what the hell we were gonna do...
</p>

<p>As it may be clear by now; we didn't get it in a finished state in time. It's "playable", the gameplay is all there
    technically, just we never managed to get any proper visuals in and didn't manage to set up a proper narrative or...
    Anything of the sort really. It's a shame but, whatever, it probably wasn't going to end up being very great anyway.
    There was a lot of mixup on what the heck we were doing, once again because we spent way to long trying to figure that
    out. It's also why there's no link to the game like there is for my other jams in the Games section of the portfolio,
    because the game never got finished so we don't really have anything big to show for it. Most of the people on our team
    were busy, so we won't be able to go back to it to finish it off any time soon.
</p>

<p>Still, it was certainly a fun experience and I'd happily work with them again, maybe. Shout out to Devious Danish in particular,
    he was probably my most preferred teammate in the jam.
