    In 2006 Jeannette M. Wing published a scientific paper called "Computational thinking and thinking about computing" (find <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~wing/publications/Wing08a.pdf">here</a>)
    and along with it published an article which you can find <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~15110-s13/Wing06-ct.pdf">here</a>. As part of my application for Cambridge I was asked to read, understand,
    and form oppinions on this, and so I did. And I also decided to write this blog post as my opinions are... Well I could see them being controversial as I do not agree with miss Wing's statements.

    I mean, I agree with some of it. Logical thinking is a very important skill and should absolutely be better taught within schools, but note that key difference in word. <i>Logical</i>, not computational.
    Computational thinking, or as they're putting it thinking like a computer scientist, is a flawed and backwards idea. It makes far more sense to try to teach logical thinking, just as it makes much more sense
    to not try to link choosing the shortest queue to stand in at a shopping mall and "performance modelling for multi-server systems" - a connection that is contrived and backwards.
</p>

<p>
    I fear that it might be coming off like I'm saying that we shouldn't teach kids things like problem abstraction or backtracking through issues or other valuable skills used by computer scientists - so I wish
    to clarify exactly what I suggest here. I simply suggest that we teach kids to think in ways computer scientists do, but not teach them to think like computer scientists. And we really shouldn't try to convey
    computational thinking as the next step in human evolution, as Wing's article somewhat seems to be trying to sneakily imply...
</p>

<p>
    On top of this, I feel that trying to make the average person think like a computer scientist is backwards or even downright against what computer scientists actually do. For surgeons, computers are <i>beyond</i>
    vital for them to complete their job, however they don't need to know computational thinking. They don't need to know how to perform search optimisation to be able to look up information on their patients, they
    don't need to know how to do performance and priority modelling to work the systems that use such algorithms. They just need the computer to be able to do it. Sure they could spend 6 months learning how it all works,
    but it would be of little use to them and surely we'd all prefer them to spend time learning new and better techniques on how to do their actual job.

    The goal of computer scientists and programmers is not to make other people be like us, it's to design the tools and systems so they don't have to be.
