<p>It's quite clear that Jalopy was a real development hell for Pryjmachuk, which is very unfortunate for him given the
    game was originally supposed to be a passion project and a portfolio piece for them. The Game was only originally
    intended to just have included packing gear in the trunk and driving; but over time more and more and more was added
    and issues quickly started to build up.
</p>

<p>I don't think the blame really falls on any particular group here, Pryjmachuk and Excalibur both were as on board with
    the changes as one another from what I can tell, but it still most certainly serves as an example of how things can
    go so very, very bad when you don't stop making a game more and more mechanic heavy.
