<p>This is really interesting to see, in all honesty. I mean, if nothing else I actually didn't at first realize that
    developers got money off their trading cards (Which isn't mentioned in the article but I found out upon doing some
    of my own research and thought interesting enough to share). I mean, it makes sense, but it still doesn't change how 
    I was surprised about it. The psychological effect of the card sales is also surprising, but once again also makes
    sense. I mean, if I poured my desire and effort into a game for that long, only to find out that people were buying
    it to idle and make a profit over useless cards instead of to enjoy the actual game itself would be really demoralizing.
</p>

<p>But thing is... There's not really much that can be done to fix that, is there? You could remove the trading all together,
    but that's really over the top and kinda dumb. You could cap the price of what you can sell the cards for to, perhaps say
    to game's actual price; but even then you'd be making a profit since you get 4 or 5 cards in total, so you'd still be making
    400% extra of what you put in and I doubt Valve would want to go lower than that since they absolutely <i>do</i> make
    money of the sales, which I doubt surprises anyone here. There's not really much that can be done to fix it really, at least
    short of basically scrapping the idea of the trading card marketplace which Valve is simply never going to do.
</p>

<p>All the same, developers can feel at peace knowing that some people buy the game for the gameplay and to have a fun time,
    and if they do try to make a profit off the cards it's simply an added benefit. As for me, I want to get the game for not
    the profit, nor the gameplay.... I want the cute purple squid girl.
