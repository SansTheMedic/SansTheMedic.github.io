<p>One thing that is really interesting to me about this is how the person who had created this system was actually from a
    physics background rather than a computer science or games development one. At first it struck me as odd that a person 
    from such a wildly academic background instead of one aimed at entertainment could fit so well; but when I thought about
    it; all of these fields really use comupter science a great deal as it's such an important and useful skill, and the
    algorithms used to create the star systems and simulate them are almost certainly already used within the field he comes
    from.

    It's quite surprising to me that despite the sheer quantity of things the system still has to compute, the system they
    use is something they consider "fast". However I do not know the exact systems nor any of the likely hundreds of other
    things they also implement to cut down on time so all I can really do is take into account that it is definitely faster
    than simulating the whole galaxy, and by a great margin. The system with nebulas particularly is one that still feels
    like it should be slow, as the system feels like some more complicated version of raycasting that worked backwards;
    but then again, it could possibly be quite fast since raycasting was a technology used back in the 1982 (from the
    quick research I did) so it could quite possibly be that the technology is as processor intensive as a quick sort
    algorithm.
