    First off, I genuinely wonder how the heck minecraft does it. Like seriously, you'd think
    minecraft would have a relatively simple chunk loading system, using some perlin noise like
    the online couse I took did, but no. There <i>has</i> to be <i>something</i> they do, because
    my attempt ran terribly!

</div>

<p>Not only would it take several seconds for the game to load new (and old) chunks, but it was doing
    so when my render distance of chunks was only 2! in minecraft I can easily and reliably run 12+
    chunk render distance before I get into awkward load times. And not only that, but my chunks were
    far simpler to render! Only grass dirt and stone, caves, water, redstone and diamond, and a single
    tree type. Minecraft has a ton of extra things to load!
</p>

<p>I have no idea what on earth extra minecraft does to save on load times, since the course showed
    a lot of optimisation tactics of it's own, but there must be something quite crazy that Mojang did
    and continues to do to keep the game running as smooth as it does. That or it was just a unity engine
    thing and if I packaged it into it's own .exe it'd run fine.
