<h1>Welcome</h1>
    <p>Hello! Welcome to my portfolio; my name is Jack Bland though I also go by the name Sans_the_Medic online. Feel
        free to take a look around, since if you're here it's probably because you're looking at what I've
        done for business related purposes like University or hiring me. You'll find more about me in the About section,
        the games and prototypes I've made in the Games section, the ideas for mechanics in the Thinktank
        section, a chronicle of my thoughts about the scape of gaming/computer science and articles I've read in the
        Blog section, and other misc stuff such as stories and artwork in the Other Stuff section.
    </p>

    <p>Hope you like the new background image, by the way. Felt like this needed some decorating but could never find
        something that looked good until now.
    </p>
