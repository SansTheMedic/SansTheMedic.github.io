<h2>The History</h2>

<p>I have a certain fondness for these sorts of one player vs a team games, despite never playing them. I
    suppose part of that stems from my fondness of a genre that I see as a distant cousin and have actually
    played before; secret roll games. You might be pretty confused as to why I consider these two similar,
    and I wouldn't blame you as my reasoning is a bit odd. It's because of the fact that there are (typically)
    two sides; one of which having more numbers but less power and the other having more power but far less
    numbers. Secret role games add the element of the side with more players not knowing who's who but the
    other side knowing everything; but they sacrifice some of the potency of the small team being incredibly
    powerful that these 1vMany asymetric games have.
</p>

<p>Because boy are these 1vMany game potent with how much more power they give the single player. Games like
    Evolve show the shallower end of that spectrum, being very head to head action but just with one side
    being incredibly strong. On the other side of the spectrum is Friday the Thirteenth: the Game; where the
    team can't do anything to harm the killer (well okay maybe in Friday the 13th they CAN but that's only
    through a tricky route that takes a LOT of co-ordination) while all the killer has to do is pop infront
    of you using his multitude of abilities and tap you, and then you're instantly Slasher Filmed to death.

    <h4>Ouch, that's gotta hurt.</h4>
</div>

<p>So which style is better? the almost sorta close to level playing field of Doom Eternal's Battlemode or
    the you can do nothing but run nigh-unstoppable power difference of Dead by Daylight? Well.... Neither!
    Neither of them are better than the other and they both can perform well. However, I think there's a
    particular golden zone in having a middleground where the players can fight back, but there's still
    plenty tension. This can come from the baddie being invisible AND respawning as in Last Night; a 5v1
    game where 5 students with abilities that allow them to fight back go up against one bad guy killer
    who can select from three equally powerful villains that can dissapear, lay rather disgusting looking
    bear-trap like snares, have unique insta-kill spots, AND can be switched between every time the killer
    dies (because the killer can be killed, but they keep coming back). Another sort of middle ground comes
    in games that allow the players to fight back against a killer with one life but is significantly stronger,
    kinda like in evolve but with a much bigger power gap. Two notable examples of this are Squad's new hit mod
    themed on the Alien(s) franchise, and how the recently released and promising-looking Predator: Hunting
    Grounds seems to and hopefully will play.
</p>

<h2>The Idea</h2>

<p>Predator: Hunting Grounds has particularly excited me and gotten me thinking about it. It seems to be in
    similar vein to Behaviour Interactive's Deathgarden: BLOODHARVEST, just actually good. Maybe Bloodharvest
    is good too actually, just I haven't seen any footage of it that actually looks it.
</p>

    <h5>I really don't mean to hate on it that much but... It really just does NOT look very fun</h5>
</div>

<p>I could see the idea of Hunting Grounds, or at least it's gameplay ideas, working REALLY well with almost
    hero shooter-like mechanics. The survivor/soldier/whatever team would be a loadout and customize system
    ala basically every online FPS game in existance nowadays; but the killer team would have a lovely lovely
    selection of powerful characters to choose from. If you'll excuse me I'm gonna start listing some of my
    OCs because they work incredibly well at explaining this.
</p>

<p>I can see the killers working really well with a spectrum of versitility or variety and potency, or wide and
    tall I suppose. Some killers would have wide styles with incredibly varied, jack of all trade kits of multiple
    abilities; others with one single ability that wasn't very varied but was extrememly potent.
</p>

<p>My character Sam Shepard would be very good at being the versatile end of the spectrum with his prosthetic arm.
    He'd not only have access to his firearms but the numerous little bits and bobs he has in it from his micro-missile
    to his energy shield to his pneumatic fist. This would offer numerous useful skills allowing him to work in many
    situations among close and medium ranges, with less options at long range but still some abilities.
</p>

<p>Then on the other side is potency, and who is better to show that than his best friend Clara Goldfist. Her ability
    to control the flow of the hyper-adrenaline in her body and basically slow her perception of time while making her
    move faster than otherwise humanly possible opens a powerful ability that would be like a blade rush; allowing you
    to move at a high speed and collide with enimies causing large damage or perhaps even small animations that lead to
    insta-kills. It would also be useful at helping the killer get out if they're in a tough spot; but it's really built
    to be a potent tool for being very fast and hit and run.
</p>

<p>And there is even some room for a potent single ability that allows for a lot of versatility, a best of both worlds
    sort of deal, with characters like Blanc Shepard. Her "ability" within the game would be her Railjack modular rifle,
    her primary and only weapon. This would mean she technically only had one attack; but the Railjack is overwhelmingly
    open to modification of everything from scope to barrel length to the calibre of bullet that's chambered. This would
    allow Blanc to be able to fight incredibly well in any situation she wanted, but would come with the issue that if
    the opposing team managed to get her into a situation that her current Railjack setup was unfit to use in, the killer
    will have to waste precious time switching out parts to allow them to fight back all the while the survivors are getting
    a bunch of free hits in.
</p>

<h2>The Idea, The Second</h2>

<p>There was another idea I had, however... a 1vMany Tower Defence game.</p>

<p>I know it sounds kinda stupid but seriously, trust me on this one, I think it's got the ability to go places. You see,
    arguably one of the most well known and well reputed Tower Defence franchises is the Bloons TD series. And with good
    reason; the game is really well made and really really fun! But they don't just have those strict TD games, they in
    fact have a few spinoff franchises as well. There was the Touhou bullet hell Bloons Super Monkey (which I think got
    a sequel), the Bloons Monkey City game who's genre is like.... Tower defence meets Clash of Clans? Maybe? It's really
    weird. Any way, the most important spinoff for this conversation was Bloons TD Battles. 
</p>

<div style="text-align: center">
    <img src="images\thinktankSketches\btdb.jpg" width="40%" height="auto">
</div>

<p>Battles was an interesting concept;
    a cut down TD with a short map and only bringing 3 towers of your choice + a random one, and then you face of 1v1,
    mano a mano, against another player with their own 3+1 towers. The REALLY interesting part however comes from the
    attack mechanic of the game. You see, not only are you spending cash on placing and upgrading your defences, you are
    ALSO spending it to send baloons at the enemy to try and kill them to win the game. Of course you can just let the AI
    spawned baloons that also appear do the job, but then you'll also be at a deficite there because of the fact that buying
    bloons increases how much you get from your periodic income; allowing your next attack to be even stronger.
</p>

<p>My second idea is to take that idea of both having to build towers and send enemies out and create a 1vMany game out of it.
    A team of defenders each having to build towers to defend against one player that sends out waves of enemies to kill
    them. How this would exactly play out or balance I have no idea; but there would definitely be room in which this could
    work and I'd be quite interested to see what games could do with the idea of a tower defence game where it's a player
    that controls the endless tide of creatures charging the defences.
