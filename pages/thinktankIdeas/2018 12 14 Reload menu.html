<h2>The History</h2>

<p>Normally in video games, you're only ever given one ammo type for a weapon. If you're able to fire variants to that,
    most of the time that is definied by the weapon itself (typically a weapon upgrade tree or attachment system). There
    are of course still many games that do allow multiple ammo types but their systems for doing it may be awkward at times.

<p>In games like terraria, you have a LOT of ammo types to choose from for weapons, however if you're carrying multiple
    for the same weapon (eg both jester and flame arrows for your bow) you'll encounter the problem of how Terraria chooses
    which ammo it uses. It's all dependent on the inventory slot; so if you need to switch from one ammo type to another
    you have to open your inventory, select the ammo you want to use, switch it's position with the one you had just been
    using, possibly close your inventory, and THEN finally be able to continue shooting. Now, in singleplayer, if you have
    the option that makes the game pause when you're in your escape menu - which can be annoying to have open simply because
    there are times you want the menu open but the game still going like when you're fishing - enabled it's fine; but in
    multiplayer which many people will want to play in there is no way to pause the fight so you're at a massive disadvantage.
</p>

<p>Bohemia Interactive's ARMA 3 uses a very good solution that comes from it's action menu. See, when you press the scroll
    button (often labelled as "mouse 3") a menu that lists a bunch of actions the player can do in that current location
    such as open inventory, open doors, get in a number of seats for a vehicle, use medical supplies to heal oneself, and
    reload or switch ammo type. This action menu can even be scripted to add new items, as seen (blurily) in the image below.
    There two real downsides to that system though. The first is how you would need a bit more than just being able to change
    ammo type to fully justify the system's creation; and the second is that it still isn't fully realistic because of how
    for weapons like shotguns or revolvers you cannot load more than one of each type of ammo into it.

<h2>The Idea</h2>

<p>My idea hopes to remedy that latter issue while still giving a rather simple and on the fly method of reloading. Here's
    how it works:
</p>

<p>When the player reloads they'r greeted with a small menu, a transparent one to not too greatly bring the player out of
    the game (such as the one shown below, Garry's mod's Fire Arms: Source system). In that menu the player would be given
    all the ammo types that they have along with how much they have, and using hotkeys would select which ammo type they
    wanted to load. For shotguns and revolvers and other such weapons, they'd repeat the selection the amount of times needed
    to fill the weapon OR press escape or some other key to only load the weapon partially.
</p>

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="images\thinktankSketches\FAS 2.0 reload.jpg" width="50%" height="auto"></div>

<p>This idea does come with a few issues; the main one of which is how since the hotkeys would likely be best keyed to
    the number keys or a numpad, the player would have to either stop moving or turning since they would likely have to
    take their hand off of either the mouse of the movement keys. That being said, this could be symbolic of how if it
    were real, the person reloading would have to put some of their focus into doing said reloading and take it out of
    moving or looking around. Even then, with the explaination, it may not be fun for the player, which is something that
    should always take more importance than realism and making sense...
</p>

<p>Another issue caused is from how the animation of the reload would have to be paused at parts or there would need to be
    multiple animations for the reload. the reason for this is because the player may need a moment to decide which ammo
    type they wish to use, and so the animation will have to pause so it's not reloading before the player had decided. An
    alternate solution COULD be to force the player to decide in that timeframe or suffer some penalty but that is frankly
    stupid and would not be fun for the player so it's far for the best that not be the solution.
