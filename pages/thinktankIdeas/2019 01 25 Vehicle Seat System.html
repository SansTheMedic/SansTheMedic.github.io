<h2>The History</h2>

<p>Vehicles in video games have been around for a long, and I mean LONG time now, and its very unlikely they're going anywhere any time soon.
    In video games that contain vehicles and multiple players being able to play at once, there usually are vehicles that have multiple seats
    in so people can ride together; typically this is only in games where the vehicles can be entered and exited at will so you aren't always
    in vehicles, though there are vehicle-based games like Elite: Dangerous that allow you to take a ride in a friend's vehicle instead of
    your own.

<p>The current common system for how players entered these vehicles was to go to the door next to the seat you wanted to sit in, and press
    whatever key allowed you to enter the vehicle; then Boom! You're in that seat. This works well for small vehicles; motorbikes, tanks,
    cars, jets, et cetera. But for larger vehicles; APCs, buses, transport trucks and helicopters, dropships, and other such vehicles with
    large quantities of seats... How do you say what seat on the Chinook you want to ride into battle in from the sole access ramp?
</p>

<p>One system I know that does this well is Garry's mod. Well, one set of vehicle addons from Garry's mod at least. It's a set of Star Wars
    vehicles, and for ships like the LAAT transport that had rows of seats players could actually walk inside the model and enter the
    individual chairs. This works and it works well, however there are still big drawbacks. For one, The model will have to be made in a way
    that allows the player to walk inside it which will take time and increase the file size of the vehicle. Another potential issue is the
    physics issues that could form the player and vehicle colliding, and we all know how that can go...

<p>I had expected ARMA 3 to pull through with it's context menu system to create a well functioning if not overwhelmingly pretty method of
    doing it (for explaination see the Reload Menu idea in the think tank section): but no, they offer very little. ARMA 3's system, when it
    comes to seats that aren't special like gunner or driver, just automatically allocate you instead of allowing you to choose your seat.
    Some would argue that this is fine as they're just useless passenger seats so who really cares? I argue that there is reason, however.
</p>

<p>For one, I am a big fan of roleplay and sure, most of the time you're not gonna care which of the 15 spots on the HEMTT's bench you're on,
    there are moments in which it can help character and roleplay wise. Maybe your character needs to sit in a certain position to fulfil their
    role or maybe they have a feud with some other character and don't want to sit next to them. Maybe your character wants to sit as far from
    the exit as possible as it's an opening and they want to minimise the chance of getting shot as much as possible.
</p>

<p>Another reason that I think it's important is that there are mechanical reasons why your character would sit in specific spots, ones that
    aren't tied to roleplay and instead to the player's choice of what they have. For example, give me one good reason why - in a vehicle like
    a HEMTT - when there is a chance the players may have to shoot out the back of the transport truck at pursuers, the person with the sniper
    rifle and ghillie suit should be next to the opening and the person with the shotgun and super heavy armour is as far away from it as
    possible. If you can actually come up with a sensible reason, I'll be amazed.
</p>

<h2>The Idea</h2>

<p>So is there any real way to get the players able to enter vehicles in the seat they want, other than the effort and expense of making a
    full modelled interior that the player can actually get inside? Well, let's talk a little tiny bit about battlefield.
</p>

<p>In Battlefield 1, and other games in the series (presumably, I dunno I've never played BF), when you were in vehicles you would have a little
    display of all the slots of the vehicle and who was in what slot if there were players in it. My idea would use something VERY similar, but
    instead of being a little display at the bottom of your screen when you were already in the vehicle, it'd be a nice big menu in the middle of
    your screen when you were entering it or switching seat (Although it wouldn't be an opaque box menu because that would be disgustingly ugly
    and intrusive)
</p>

<div style="text-align: center"><img width="30%" height="auto" src="images\thinktankSketches\BF5 vehicle menu thingy.png">
</div>

<p>If you were to just press the key to get into the vehicle (or hold it for a short time to stop players accidentally entering vehicles that they
    didn't want to), the game would auto assign the seat as normal. However, if one were to hold the key a little bit longer than that then a
    menu similar to that of the BF1 display would appear; allowing you to select which empty seat you wanted to get into.
</p>

<p>I believe that this system works because it allows the player to have the choice of where they want to sit while still giving the option
    of speed if the player just needs to get in the vehicle right now because there are bullets everywhere and the exact centimetre of bench
    they're sitting on doesn't really matter to them right this second.
</p>

<p>And, if the player is already in the vehicle and wants to change seats, they just have to hold the enter key for a short period (to ensure
    it's not a misclick) and the menu will appear again; giving them a choice of where to change their seat to and a new big button at the bottom
    for if they want to get off the ride. And of course, they'll have the ability to click the seat they're still in if they change their mind.
