<h2>The History</h2>

<p>I feel personally that one of the very best parts of Xcom2 was the Character Pool. The ability to save custom characters of
    friends, family, favourite fictional characters, that one jerk who was a dick to you so you made a character out of him so
    you could watch him die repeatedly, and any other characters you wished to make is incredibly fun.

    <h6>Ruby Rose from RWBY. Or at least she WAS Ruby Rose, before becoming the explosives expert Agent Red in my Xcom2 run, landing the final blow with an overwatch to win the campaign and have me give her the "Xenobane" honorary rank</h6>

<p>Many a time I'd watch videos of Sethorvan or OverEnglishMan going through their playthroughs, and occassionally I'd drop by
    the former's live streams to watch what happened there. Many X-com youtubers and streamers would allow their viewers, 
    patreons, and subscribers to have their names on the soldiers; but Sethorvan (and to a lesser extent OverEnglishMan) went
    above and beyond; giving people the full ability to bring their own characters. I remember Nep... Uh.... Okay I kinda only
    remember Nep but that's because it's been a while; still I remember seeing all these subscriber characters not only be in
    the campaign but also have them in and directly affecting the stories and plots that Seth created while using the game as
    a canvas to tell the story of the commander and his brave soldiers. Freeman and his clones, Tear of Grace the martyr and
    later the iron machine, Al-09 the reality cutter who's strike was so powerful it deleted foes from existance itself, Blue 
    Magoo the omnipotent jester and comedic blame for all glitches; all these characters of Seth's creation
    were backed up by Nep and the other audience counterparts. I many a time planned to add my own to his list of audience added
    characters but among other issues, I didn't know who to pick. Did I go Agent Red, my most decorated soldier? Or perhaps Ashley
    "Bluebird" Ross, my first Xcom2 character taken from my EU playthrough and given a complete backstory? Maybe Sam Shepard, a
    character I not only used often in RPs all over the place but who also became something of my avatar? Or should I be a massive
    weaboo and slot in my waifu BAR, who I had also made a character for? In the end I never really made up my mind, which is a
    shame really because I'd have loved to see my character randomly appear in a video.
</p>

<p>In fact, I had done something similar myself with some friends; getting them to help me design their own character and sending
    them into missions, telling tales of their exploits. However I had always wanted to get them a little more involved with their
    characters. One thing I had wanted for some time was to have some way of having the people themselves wanted their characters
    to do, where to move and who to shoot. The problem was that it would be a slow, difficult method to do, especially since the
    characters wouldn't always have their owners online; so I never ended up attempting it.

</div>

<p>And even now I feel like it's a massive shame that I never figured out a way to get it to work. It'd have been incredibly fun,
    I'm certain of it! But with how Xcom and life works, it never could. And because the PvP multiplayer of Xcom EU and Xcom2 are
    as big of a mess as their infamy shows, those games have always been a mostly single player experience...
</p>

<p>But that doesn't have to always be the case.</p>

<h2>The Idea</h2>

<p>Xcom's modern two installments have had very simple but still very deep and engaging mechanics: each soldier has two action
    points and could move, dash, shoot, enter overwatch, hunker down, or use special abilities and utility items for some, all
    or none of those points. That explaination in itself still makes it sound more complicated than it really is. It has extreme
    depth for very little complexity, and that is an extremely good system. It's also a system that would work well for a co-op
    turn based game.
</p>

<p>In truth, there are surprisingly few co-op games that use turn based strategy - Xcom's style of turn based at least. But the
    idea of a turn based strategy game where each player takes control of one member of an squad and played missions with a
    gameplay style of Xcom I feel would be a very new and interesting experience. The one issue is the decision of how you decide
    player turns.
</p>

<p>There are two main options for this solution; either you could have the player turns go seperately and use a turn order system
    like that of table top RPGs like D&D or Pathfinder, or you have all of the players' moves activate simultaneously. Both of
    these systems would offer very different experiences and would be more applicable in different situations than the other, but
    I personally think that having each action resolve simultaneously would be more often applicable and better give the feelings
    of co-operative strategy that the game would need to have.

        <h4>Imagine you and your friends each being in this situation together, planning out how you're gonna unfuck the situation as if you were the soldiers in the field</h4>
</div>

<p>I don't know why this has never been attempted. Maybe it has been; maybe there is a reason it hasn't hit mainstream. But I
    think that done well it would offer an incredibly fun and interesting multiplayer experience.
