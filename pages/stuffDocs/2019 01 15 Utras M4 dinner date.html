<p>Hopefully I've edited this so that there isn't that much stuff that needs explaining, but I'll explain what still needs to be.
    Ultra is one of the commanders of Zenith base, a PMC owned semi-secret base of operations in the UK. M4 is a combat android called
    a "Doll", and Ultra and M4 are in a relationship. Commander Sam 'Sans' Shepard is my commander character and Grizzly is another "doll".
    Sans and Ultra had both gotten into an altercation involving the combat chip in Ultra's head that turns her into an emotioness
    killer and emotion suppressant stims Sans has that do the same for him, that ended up with Ultra in hospital; and Sans decided
    to pay for a night out for M4 and Ultra as apology.

<p>_______________________________________________</p>

<p dir="ltr">Ultra finished locking the doors to the office section of Zenith, having been the last one to leave on account of lots of distractions causing her to take far longer than usual to finish all the day&rsquo;s reports; ending in her finally managing to leave
        after dark. She checked her watch, somehow not surprised it was already 7:45. The air was cold, tendrils of icy wind barely held at bay by the fortress of her scarf as she turned and started walking to the residential section; boots crunching on gravel
        with each step.</p>
    
    <p dir="ltr">Behind her she heard a rustling, though she didn&rsquo;t think much of it; assuming it was just the wind or perhaps a small animal in the bushes. That was at least until a pair of hands blocked her vision. She had no clue how her assailant had managed
        to sneak up on her, they must have snuck through the grass or something; but she wasted no time in delivering a counter attack.&nbsp;&ldquo;Guess who it i-&rdquo;&nbsp;The oddly familiar voice is cut off by the owner of it having to dodge to the side
        to avoid an elbow launched from Ultra; causing the assailant to tumble backwards onto the cold ground and liberating Ultra&rsquo;s sight. The commander drops into a fighting stance, turning to face her attacker and freezing when she realised who it
        was.</p>
    
    <p dir="ltr">The doll that was adorably giggling despite how ungracefully she&rsquo;d been knocked onto her butt had the luxury of not being able to feel cold and was as such wearing a quite stunning dress. Onyx black, flowing just shy of her knees, and fitting
        snugly around all her curves.&nbsp;&ldquo;M-M4! Oh gosh I&rsquo;m so sorry!&rdquo;&nbsp;Ultra exclaims after a moment of stunned silence, rushing over to help her lover to her feet, a blush vividly colouring her face.&nbsp;&ldquo;No, no; It&rsquo;s
        alright. Your reaction was quite adorable you dork&rdquo;&nbsp;M4 replies as she&rsquo;s helped back to her feet, giving Ultra a peck on the cheek which quite easily turned her beet red; only making M4 giggling harder.</p>
    
    <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;A-Anyways&hellip;&rdquo;&nbsp;Ultra stutters out, turning away and tugging her collar in her flustered state&nbsp;&ldquo;..W-why are you we-wearing tha-&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Oh, my dress? I thought you&rsquo;d like it~&rdquo;&nbsp;M4 interjects with a smug, playful smile. She was right, Ultra really did like the dress; it fit her so perfectly and accentuated all of her features so elegantly, and the way M4 was able
        to so effortlessly pull it off was almost divine. Ultra was pulled out of that train of thought, however, by M4&rsquo;s hand slowly and gently caressing her cheek&nbsp;&ldquo;As for why I&rsquo;m wearing it&hellip; I may or may not have booked some
        seats to a fancy restaurant a quick drive away. I thought that it would be nice for the two of us to go have a little dinner date. What do you say,&nbsp;my little dork?&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p dir="ltr">Ultra gulped, thoroughly flustered by M4&rsquo;s actions and especially the gentle stroking of her cheek. Honestly, to say she wasn&rsquo;t at least a little bit turned on by the frankly quite adorable yet seductive display would be a big fat lie; however
        she managed to keep her composure for now, if only a little.&nbsp;&ldquo;O-oh&hellip; Th-that would be nice&hellip; I&rsquo;d love to, M4.&rdquo;&nbsp;She managed to say.</p>
    
    <p dir="ltr">...Then Ultra lost all composure when she saw M4&rsquo;s reaction. The AR doll&rsquo;s face lit up in the most utterly fucking precious form of elation at hearing that her dinner date was going ahead; from experience Ultra could tell that M4 was practically
        screaming in her head; and the little&nbsp;eek&nbsp;of excitement that came out her mouth, dear lord&hellip; It took all of the dork&rsquo;s strength to not collapse there and then; looking at her lover&rsquo;s face just completely annihilated her.
        Blood trickled down her nose from the display, and Ultra rushed to wipe it off. M4, knowing it was just something her lover was prone to and of no danger, simply giggled further.&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh my adorable little dork&hellip; The reservation is for
        9 so you have time to get changed if you want. I&rsquo;ll be waiting by the motorpool!&rdquo;&nbsp;M4 said, giving Ultra one final peck on the forehead before turning and skipping away. Ultra faintly heard a scream of excitement after M4 had turned
        the corner; probably something she&rsquo;d been holding until she got out of ear shot. The commander then started to make her way to her dorm to get changed into something suitable for such a fancy date.</p>
    
    <p dir="ltr">Wait&hellip; She didn&rsquo;t have anything suitable for a fancy date&hellip; Ultra began to run.</p>
    
    <p dir="ltr">She rushed into her room and was about to start pulling her wardrobe apart to find something even remotely presentable to wear when she noticed something on the bed. It was a feminine-build tuxedo, complete with a bowtie. On top of it was a note:&nbsp;&lsquo;Ultra,
        heard about the date and realised you didn&rsquo;t have any good attire; so you can borrow one of my suits. It may feel a bit weird for you, I know you aren&rsquo;t a massive fan of these sorts of things; but trust me, it will&nbsp;slay&nbsp;M4. Your
        sister-in-law~&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p dir="ltr">Ultra couldn&rsquo;t help but chuckle at the note.&nbsp;&ldquo;God dammit M16&hellip;&rdquo;&nbsp;she muttered jokingly, before putting the note down and getting to work changing into the tux. Wherever M16 had heard Ultra didn&rsquo;t like suits was a
        wrong source of info as she didn&rsquo;t mind putting it on. Hell, if it was going to fluster M4 so much she&rsquo;d put on&nbsp;far&nbsp;worse clothes than a tux. Ultra quickly changed, made sure she looked proper, and once more ventured out into
        the night</p>
    
    <p dir="ltr">A little time later, Ultra stepped into the motor pool where her wife was supposedly waiting. Having exchanged some of her warmer clothes for the suit, the cold now saw the opening and took advantage; the chilling air causing the commander to shiver profusely.
        M4 was waiting by one of the fancier cars in the motorpool, and looked over when she noticed Ultra approaching.</p>
    
    <p dir="ltr">...Then she saw the tux. If M16 was anything; it was knowledgeable about her sister. M4 flared up almost as fast as Ultra tended to, having to look away.&nbsp;&ldquo;O-Oh god&hellip;&rdquo;&nbsp;She muttered, her breath taken away by the tux. Ultra smirked
        as she approached her now very flustered doll, taking the moment to repay M4 for earlier by stoking her cheek lovingly.&nbsp;&ldquo;Well, my little dork, what do you think?&rdquo;&nbsp;She says, adding the tiniest bit of seductive venom into her words.
        Ultra could swear that M4&rsquo;s legs were starting to shake slightly, it was bloody adorable.&nbsp;&ldquo;Um.. y-you look amazing Ultra&hellip; B-but how did y-you get-&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;It seems that being a siscon gives you omniscience&rdquo;&nbsp;Ultra says with a shrug, smirk still plastered on her face from her dork&rsquo;s adorable reaction. M4 was a little too flustered to grasp what her lover meant, but she was also a bit
        too flustered to press for an answer so the only thing she could think to do was change the subject to avoid more embarrassment.&nbsp;&ldquo;S-So, uh&hellip; Y-you ready to go?&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Born ready, dork. I&rsquo;ve been waiting for this for a&nbsp;long time&rdquo;&nbsp;Ultra teases, causing M4 to blush even harder in a spectacular backfire.&nbsp;&ldquo;R-Right.. T-then we&rsquo;re j-just waiting for our driver.&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p dir="ltr">As soon as M4 said that, someone else entered the car park. The brown haired girl had on a dull blue coat over a white shirt, was clearly a doll from the remarkably little she was wearing over her legs (some torn shorts and odd-sized stockings) and around
        her finger spun a keyring which in turn held a set of car keys.&nbsp;&ldquo;Sorry to keep you girls waiting, just got back from a mission today and M14-san was hogging the showers for&nbsp;way&nbsp;too long.&rdquo;&nbsp;She said as she approached,
        unlocking the car, an old but still very fast 4 seater sports model painted a dull yellow and with the roof non-existent, and hopping over the door into the driver&#39;s seat. M4 and Ultra chose rather to open the door and get in safely; knowing and
        fearing the consequences that would come from damaging the doll&rsquo;s prized possession.</p>
    
    <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Thanks again for this, Griz. I know it was short notice.&rdquo;&nbsp;M4 said as she clicked on her seatbelt, causing the handgun doll to wave her hand dismissively.&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing, really; I was planning on taking a joyride anyways
        so why not give you a lift on the way? You better get me those doughnuts though; chocolate glazed and sprinkles.&rdquo;&nbsp;Grizzly MkV replied, starting the engine and setting off.</p>
    
    <p dir="ltr">The car ride was a little uneventful; Ultra and M4 enjoying the scenery fly by and unconsciously holding the hand of their significant other while Grizzly blasted tunes on the radio and zoomed down the rural roads at speeds that were arguably not safe.
        The two love birds decided to let their driver have their fun; &nbsp;since the transport was being done out of simply good will and promise of doughnuts. After around half an hour, the car pulled up to the restaurant, and the dorks got out of it.
        Grizzly paused the music for a moment.&nbsp;&ldquo;When you&rsquo;re ready to be picked up, just give me a call. Have fun you two~&rdquo;&nbsp;She said teasingly before switching the music back on and driving off to god knows where.</p>
    
    <p dir="ltr">Ultra and M4 smiled, before turning to the building. Back 50 years ago, Locale had been a small italian restaurant just north of St Thomas hospital; however over the years as critics found the little place and gave it review after praising review, it
        had seen more and more customers until it was eventually able to become the biggest italian restaurant in London; 3 floors of fine red carpets, chandeliers, and brilliantly filling food. They also had a unique position where if you payed for a reservation
        on the second or third floors, which were surprisingly expensive, you&rsquo;d get your food for free. The duo started to walk to the entrance before Ultra froze, realising where they were.&nbsp;&ldquo;Wait, you got us a reservation at&nbsp;Locale?&rdquo;&nbsp;She
        gasped, incredulous at the fact.&nbsp;&ldquo;Not just that, I got us a seat at the top level&rdquo;&nbsp;The doll replied smugly; causing Ultra&rsquo;s jaw to obey the laws of Sir isaac Newton and fucking drop&nbsp;&ldquo;What? Those things go for
        up to 200 quid each! How did you pay for them?&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;I have my methods&rdquo;&nbsp;M4 said cryptically, tapping the bridge of her nose to imply a secret before giggling and half-skipping the rest of the way&nbsp;&ldquo;Come on dork!&rdquo;&nbsp;She called out to her lover, who sighed before following.</p>
    
    <p dir="ltr">In contrast to the chilly London air, the atmosphere of Locale was warm and toasty. Fiery orange light given from the chandeliers gave a pleasant feel to those sheltering from the winter bite, hidden heating systems thawed out the two as they entered,
        and the busy ground floor gave a lively atmosphere that was incredibly nice.</p>
    
    <p dir="ltr">The two lovers stood at the waiting area for a moment while the man running the station helped the group in front figure out where they were sitting. After the family of four were seated, the doorsman turned to face the two.&nbsp;&ldquo;Hello, welcome
        to Locale; do you two fine ladies have a reservation?&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Yes. Penthouse floor, under the name&nbsp;&lsquo;Fourem&rsquo;.&rdquo;&nbsp;M4 replies, to which the attendant quickly checks the reservation logs.&nbsp;&ldquo;Ah yes, here we are. Two seats at the penthouse floor under your name ma&rsquo;am. You
        will have table 5a up there; 5th window seat at your 9 o&rsquo;clock when you get up there. Here are your menus, do you wish to have me show you?&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;No thanks, we can find our way.&rdquo;&nbsp;M4 said, passing the menus to Ultra and leading her upstairs. The restaurant was&nbsp;technically&nbsp;only 3 floors, however each floor had a massively raised ceiling in order to hold the frankly giant
        chandeliers so it ended up being more like 5 floors each. A bit of a pain to walk between, sure, but by the top &ldquo;penthouse&rdquo; floor it was totally worth it for the view and if you were really lazy you could just take an elevator.</p>
    
    <p dir="ltr">Even still, the two decided upon taking the stairs, savouring the atmosphere of the environment. As they passed into the second floor they noticed that some of the area had been cut off, allowing you to see down to the floor below where the massive traditional
        kitchen was, which they hadn&rsquo;t noticed until now. The place was beautiful; and apparently according to those who visited, the food was just as good.</p>
    
    <p dir="ltr">When they got to the third floor and found their seat, Ultra could clearly see why the top floor tickets were so expensive. The window overlooked not only the river Thames but also the London eye and Big Ben. It was stunning, truly; however there was
        something else on Ultra&rsquo;s mind&hellip;</p>
    
    <p dir="ltr">M4&hellip; She looked utterly angelic at the moment. The dress caught the light in just the right way that it looked even more dazzling then before. Ultra hadn&rsquo;t noticed it quite as much until now, but the dress&nbsp;really&nbsp;accentuated her
        curves. It almost seemed to cling to her, perfectly tracing her hips and torso&hellip; and her bre-</p>
    
    <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Hey, you alright Ultra?&rdquo;&nbsp;M4 asked, catching Ultra staring but not wanting to call out&nbsp;where&nbsp;and likely cause a scene.&nbsp;&ldquo;O-Oh, uh, y-yeah. I&rsquo;m, um, I&rsquo;m fine&hellip;&rdquo;&nbsp;Ultra stammers out, incredibly
        flustered at being nearly caught staring at M4&rsquo;s breasts.&nbsp;&lsquo;At least she didn&rsquo;t spot it&rsquo;, she thought,&nbsp;&lsquo;that was good&rsquo;.&nbsp;&ldquo;Right&hellip;&rdquo;&nbsp;M4 chuckled at Ultra&rsquo;s overreaction, before
        opening her menu and scanning through it. Ultra did the same, if nothing else then to slightly get over the embarrassment.</p>
    
    <p dir="ltr">A minute or so later, a waiter approached the table.&nbsp;&ldquo;May I take your order?&rdquo;&nbsp;He looked towards Ultra, who was still struggling to find a meal she wanted above the rest; hesitated for a moment before asking&nbsp;&ldquo;What would
        you recommend?&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Personally I&rsquo;d have to say the Calzone, ma&rsquo;am. It&rsquo;s basically a pizza that&rsquo;s folded on itself and it is frankly delectable.&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Then I think I&rsquo;ll have that.&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo;&nbsp;The waiter said, before turning to M4,&nbsp;&ldquo;For you?&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll have the same. I trust the judgment of my sweetest love here.&rdquo;&nbsp;Ultra almost had a heart attack at those words; flaring up to a colour that had previously never been discovered by other humans.&nbsp;&ldquo;Two Calzone,
        understood. And for drinks?&rdquo;&nbsp;If the waiter had any reaction to Ultra&rsquo;s reaction, he hid it well. Ultra was clearly in no state to answer that, so M4 once again took initiative.&nbsp;&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll want a beer, and I&rsquo;ll
        have some red wine if you please.&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;But of course&rdquo;&nbsp;The waiter said, jotting down all of the order onto a note.&nbsp;&ldquo;Two calzone, a beer and a red wine. Anything else?&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;N-no.. We should be good&rdquo;&nbsp;Ultra managed to say, starting to come down from the heart attack that M4 had given her. The waiter nodded and left for the kitchen. Ultra stared at her lover for a moment, trying to figure out why the pet name
        made her so&hellip; Whatever the feeling was&hellip; She felt happy and embarrassed, which she should; but somehow she also felt this horrid sadness and worry within the depths of her mind...&nbsp;&ldquo;M4&hellip; sweetest love?&rdquo;&nbsp;She asked.</p>
    
    <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Well, is it not the truth? You mean the world to me Ultra. You&rsquo;re as important to me as my sisters are&hellip; No, you&rsquo;re probably&nbsp;more&nbsp;important. The love you&rsquo;ve shown me... When I&rsquo;m around you I feel so important!
        Not as a team leader, but as a person; a real person who cares for someone.&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;...Even when I-&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Of course. Even if you&rsquo;re you. Even if you don&rsquo;t have complete control all the time. I wouldn&rsquo;t love you any less, even if you went all terminator like that. I don&rsquo;t want you to feel alone in this. Nobody at Zenith does.
        We&rsquo;re&nbsp;family, Ultra; and no matter what happens, don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m ever going to hate you, please&hellip;&rdquo;&nbsp;Ultra could see tears starting to form in M4&rsquo;s eyes. She surprised M4, and even to an extent herself,
        by suddenly grabbing M4&rsquo;s hand with her own.</p>
    
    <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry... I&rsquo;m so sorry M4&hellip; For the worry I&rsquo;ve probably caused you&hellip; I don&rsquo;t want to hurt you. I&rsquo;m terrified that one day the combat chip will glitch and I&rsquo;ll suddenly attack you or our child&hellip;
        I wasn&rsquo;t thinking&hellip; I kept this from you because I was worried it would push you away&hellip; There&hellip; is honestly no reason for you to not have&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Of course there is, Ultra. The reason is because I love you; because I care about you more than anyone else. When you were in the hospital I was so scared&hellip; Hell we all were. Well, maybe not Sans to&nbsp;whole&nbsp;time but in his defense
        he was under the effects of those emotional suppressors at the time so I don&rsquo;t think he physically could be... I&rsquo;m going to be with you forever, no matter what. So please, don&rsquo;t ever feel like you&rsquo;ll push me away; alright?&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;...Alright. I promise.&rdquo;&nbsp;If it weren&rsquo;t for the location both of them would have burst into tears by now. They sat in silence for a moment; not one of awkwardness but one where they both simply accepted the facts they had told each
        other. Their hands continued to touch, idly and subconsciously brushing with one another; finding comfort in the touch of their significant other.</p>
    
    <p dir="ltr">After a while, M4 spoke up again.&nbsp;&ldquo;...Hey Ultra?&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Yes, M4?&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p dir="ltr">A curious smile played across M4&rsquo;s face,&nbsp;&ldquo;If you had to pick one feature, what would be the best thing about me?&rdquo;&nbsp;This caused Ultra some small shock, and the shock turned to confusion.&nbsp;&ldquo;M4&hellip; How could I choose?
        You&rsquo;re perfect in every way&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Surely there&rsquo;s one thing you like more than the rest?&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p dir="ltr">Ultra thought for a moment.&nbsp;&ldquo;Alright&hellip; The thing I like the most about you&hellip;&rdquo;&nbsp;She leaned in and whispered in her ear&nbsp;&ldquo;...Is everything&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p dir="ltr">Ultra devolved into a fit of giggles for a moment at saying this, not helped by the adorable pout of M4&rsquo;s face&nbsp;&ldquo;heeeey, you can&rsquo;t cop out of this like that!&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Well then I don&rsquo;t have any answer. Like I said, you&rsquo;re my perfect little dork in every single way.&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p dir="ltr">M4 blushed again, and was about to say something when the waiter came back.&nbsp;&ldquo;Sorry for the wait, ladies. Here are your meals and drinks&hellip;&rdquo;&nbsp;He took the dishes, which had been balanced perfectly on a tray somehow, and set them
        down in front of the couple along with their drinks.&nbsp;&ldquo;Enjoy the meal.&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p dir="ltr">The two of them tucked in; and god if the critics weren&rsquo;t spot on. This shit was delectable. The two ate mostly in silence, though they almost constantly glanced and smiled at each other. Midway through the meal; M4 surprised Ultra by offering her
        a forkful of her calzone. After a moment of surprise, Ultra leaned forward to allow her dork to feed her; before doing the same with her own meal. M4 blushed at the returned offer, and was a bit more embarrassed to eat it, but she did. Truly, this
        love could never be extinguished&hellip;</p>
    
    
    
    
    <p dir="ltr">_________________</p>
    <p dir="ltr">Epilogue</p>
    <p dir="ltr">_________________</p>
    
    <p dir="ltr">Hallways of Zenith base, the next day.</p>
    
    
    <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;So, M4; how was the date?&rdquo;&nbsp;Sam asked, having managed to catch M4 on the way to his lab. A smile played across his face as he saw M4 beam from the memory&nbsp;&ldquo;It was amazing! I loved every second of it&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p dir="ltr">Sam chuckled at the adorable little doll and ruffled her hair, only somewhat cognisant of the fact that Ultra would kill him if she saw. M4&rsquo;s giggle was worth it.&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you enjoyed yourself, M4.&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Still&hellip; How&rsquo;d you get the money to pay for us?&rdquo;&nbsp;M4 asked, knowing that it had actually been Sans&rsquo; idea for the dinner date in the first place.&nbsp;&ldquo;I took some extra money out of my research budget for the month
        and spent my savings.&rdquo;&nbsp;The researcher answered matter-of-factly, as if him spending all of his money and then some on the couple was a basic thing.</p>
    
    <p dir="ltr">M4 saw differently.&nbsp;&ldquo;What? Why? You didn&rsquo;t have to do that!&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Well I had to do something to make up for&hellip; Well&hellip; You know what&hellip;&rdquo;&nbsp;he answered, looking away due to the shame of it still being hot on his mind even over a week later. M4 shook her head in disagreement;&nbsp;&ldquo;Sans,
        you&rsquo;ve got to stop worrying about that. It&rsquo;s really not your fault&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Perhaps not&hellip;&rdquo;&nbsp;Sans sighed,&nbsp;&ldquo;But even if you and Ultra and everyone else have forgiven me. I needed to do this so I could forgive myself. Just&hellip;. Let it be what it is, okay?&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;...Alright. But just so you know, I&rsquo;m going to pay you back for this either way.&rdquo;&nbsp;M4 said, a look of determination in her eyes.</p>
    
    <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;That really won&rsquo;t be necessary.&rdquo;&nbsp;Sans chuckled,&nbsp;&ldquo;But I can tell I&rsquo;m not going to be able to change your mind, so alright.&rdquo;&nbsp;Sans started to continue to his lab; however M4 called out to him again.</p>
    
    <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Sam!&rdquo;</p>
    <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Thank you!&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Heh, you&rsquo;re welcome kiddo.&rdquo;</p>
