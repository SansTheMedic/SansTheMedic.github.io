<h2>Determining Real Life Viability of Fictional Characters</h2>
<div class='blogarticlebreak'></div>
<div class='blogarticlebreak'></div>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The land of fiction is a place where many things happen; no limits of biology, physics or 
    chemistry, you can create whatever you want. If you create a game that takes place in the “real 
    world”, however, it could make sense to create creatures that are able to exist within reality.
</p>

<p>Look at some of the creatures from these sorts of settings and testing the viability of their 
    being able to exist in our reality reveals much about what could exist on our planet. One game 
    having interesting characters to study is the “Left 4 Dead” series by Valve Corporation, a 
    4-player co-operative first person shooter set in modern America during an outbreak that turned 
    everyone into crazed cannibals and mutated many into hideous creatures with terrifying abilities; 
    such as the Boomer that explodes into a cloud of bile that attracts other infected or the Tank 
    that is a wall of muscle and anger capable of tearing chunks out of the concrete and flinging 
    them over large distances.
</p>

<p>We will focus on four infected types; the Smoker with their long tongue used to ensnare prey, the 
    Hunter that pounces onto their prey from long range, the Spitter that shoots concentrated acid 
    balls, and the Witch that only attacks if you startle it.
</p>
<div class='blogarticlebreak'></div>
<p>To determine the viability we need to discuss the general traits of the infected.</p>

<p>The virus, the “green flu”, is an aggressive, highly mutative, airborne disease causing infected 
    individuals to show aggression, cannibalistic desires, and mutate extreme adaptions, making them 
    into “special infected”. 
</p>

<p>The question raised is whether the symptoms and mutations are possible.</p>

<p>The former is feasible when we take a look at diseases like the Rabies virus. Rabies’ latter 
    symptoms include anxiety and insomnia<sup><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/rabies/symptoms-causes/syc-20351821">1</a></sup> , showing pathogens can modify behaviour and 
    induce mental issues.
</p>

<p>The latter is more complicated. Viruses are known for being highly mutative; diseases such as 
    Hepatitis C and HIV are successful at surviving in their host bodies because they quickly mutate.<sup><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000565">2</a></sup> 
    The Green Flu mutates so rapidly that scientists can’t isolate it properly. As for the growths 
    the mutations in the virus cause it is more speculative. Viruses such as Hepatitis C cause cancer 
    but the mutations shown by the special infected are far beyond simple cancer. Changes to DNA are 
    capable of causing deformities, so just as changes to the body’s genetic code can cause cancer 
    the virus could alter a cell’s genetic code to cause it to create such mutations.
</p>

<h3>The Smoker</h3>
<p>The Smoker infected have massive tumour-like growths on the side of their face and an elongated 
    tongue. This tongue is its main attack method; shooting it out and wrapping it around a survivor, 
    pulling them towards it and any other infected nearby. The tongue is able to shoot up to 16 
    metres, as shown by the image below of the range of the tongue, measured using the Uzi on 
    the table as size reference. Upon death the Smoker bursts into a cloud of thick smoke.
</p>

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="images\smoker tongue.jpg" width="50%" height="auto"></div>

<p>Three questions need to be asked about viability; whether their tongue could be shot at that range, 
    whether the tongue would be able to wrap around the person as it does, and whether the Smoker 
    could emit the cloud of smoke upon death.
</p>

<p>The first and second questions are both yes. Frogs and toads have the ability to launch their 
    tongue over distances to catch prey; using a strong adhesive and incredibly soft tissue to stick 
    prey onto their tongue.<sup><a href="https://www.npr.org/2017/02/04/513388242/pretty-disgusting-snot-like-spit-lets-frogs-catch-their-prey">3</a></sup> If the tumour-like growth was a storage and “firing mechanism” 
    for the tongue it would be possible to launch the tongue to latch onto prey. The tongue differs 
    from a frog’s in the way that it keeps hold of its prey as not only does it wrap around victims, 
    it has a very rough texture as shown in the image below whereas frog tongues are required 
    to be incredibly soft (10x softer than the human tongue) for the adhesive to work.<sup><a href="https://www.npr.org/2017/02/04/513388242/pretty-disgusting-snot-like-spit-lets-frogs-catch-their-prey">4</a></sup>
</p>

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="images\pretty face.jpg"></div>

<p>For wrapping around the victim, the tongue would have to be highly prehensile for this to work. 
    It is feasible that the tongue could move in such a way. The human tongue is quite flexible, so 
    if the tongue was elongated it could be easy for a Smoker to coil its tongue around a target.
</p>

<p>Unfortunately while the Smoker’s tongue is viable, the opposite must be said for its cloud of 
    smoke. The only place that it could reasonably be stored in is the growth on its mouth, but that 
    is where the tongue is stored. The room required for the tongue and muscles needed would leave no 
    space for smoke, so the smoke cannot be stored. Also the storage of smoke could be dangerous for 
    the host due to how much pressure the gas would have to be under to explode out as it does (there’s 
    a reason we use metal tanks for pressurised gas storage) and the fact that this increased pressure 
    would mean harmful substances such as Carbon Monoxide, Nitrogen Oxides, and particulates which are 
    all found in smoke could diffuse into the blood and tissue of the Smoker at an increased rate.<sup><a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/stelprdb5318238.pdf">5</a></sup> 
</p>
<div class='blogarticlebreak'></div>
<h3>The Hunter</h3>

<p>The Hunter infected have one of the less intense mutations of the special infected types; quite a 
    statement given their appearance. All over their skin of their limbs are countless large blisters, 
    Hunters seem to have hands reddened and unable to be held flat. They can leap great distances and 
    latch onto walls and attack by pouncing on their prey and clawing at them to disembowel anyone 
    they catch.
</p>

<p>There are three questions brought about the Hunter’s viability; could they leap those large 
    distances, could they latch onto and hang on walls, and whether their hands are able to rip 
    through human flesh.
</p>

<p>The Hunter’s viability falls apart from the very first question. The Hunter’s pounce clearly works 
    like that of most frogs; however, their hind legs just don’t facilitate this as they do not match 
    frogs’ legs properly. The main factor being how the hind legs of frogs contain two joints whereas 
    the Hunter only has the knee. This extra joint allows the frog – which is much lighter than any 
    human being – to get the force required to have the momentum to launch itself such distances.
</p>

<p>Using the equation <b>Force = (Mass x Velovity)/Time</b>, taking the average male weight of US 
    adult males of 88.8 kilograms<sup><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/series/sr_03/sr03_039.pdf">6</a></sup>, estimating the velocity needed as 30 mph or 13.5 m/s, and 
    estimating the time the force is exerted during as 0.1 seconds we get a force of just under 12 
    kilonewtons; without taking into account the extra force required to overcome the force of g
    ravity. It takes a third of that force to break the femur, the strongest bone in the human body.<sup><a href="https://www.seeker.com/how-much-force-does-it-take-to-break-a-bone-2056139307.html">7</a></sup> 
    This force is simply beyond human capability.
</p>

<p>Hanging off surfaces is different. If one knew biology they would first say they worked similarly 
    to that of insects, making use of tiny spines or hairs in the hands and feet to grip to the 
    surfaces they were trying to climb due to having a large surface-area to weight ratio and being 
    easily able to cling on using surface tension. However this falls apart due to the fact that in 
    the first of the two Left 4 Dead games the Hunter’s appearance shows them to be wearing clothes 
    that cover their feet and legs meaning the only part of them giving grip using hairs would be the 
    hands which would not be able to support the body weight. Also as a creature’s size increases its 
    surface area increases by a square but volume and weight increase by a cube (also known as 
    square-cube law). The surface-area to weight ratio means there is no way the Hunter could grip 
    like that.
</p>

<p>An alternate explanation is necessary; the Hunter’s nails. These nails have been hardened to act 
    like a climber’s ice pick, piercing walls and allowing the Hunter to hang there. This is possible 
    seeing as numerous real-life animals have claws extending from their digits and can use them to 
    latch onto walls. This would add the additional advantage of also answering the question of 
    whether the Hunter would be able to claw open human flesh; as sharp claws like that can easily 
    tear flesh.
</p>

<p>The Hunter infected acts like a typical ambush predator, pouncing on prey that don’t see it 
    approach and ripping through it with sharp claws. However the Hunter within Left 4 Dead with its 
    ability to leap from rooftops and pounce down entire alleyways to get to their prey are 
    impossible due to the leg structure of the human host.
</p>
<div class='blogarticlebreak'></div>
<h3>The Spitter</h3>

<p>The Spitter infected seem to be all female, possibly due to the virus affecting female DNA, and 
    have one of the more grotesque physical appearances of the special infected. The neck is 
    elongated and around it tends to be several large blisters that (based on the abilities of the 
    infected) seem to have been caused by acid burns. On top of this the jaw of the Spitter infected 
    is unhinged and the mouth is a gaping maw with an enlarged throat.
</p>

<p>They attack by shooting balls of stomach acid over long ranges. These balls highly concentrated 
    acid able to be launched and burst into pools with a radius of about 6 feet upon impact, 
    corroding anyone caught in it.
</p>

<p>The Spitter infected bring up three questions about their viability: Is it possible for the Spitter 
    to produce acid capable of severely injuring a person? Is it possible for the Spitter to safely 
    store that? Is it possible for the Spitter to shoot that much that far?
</p>

<p>The first question is yes. The acid found within the human stomach is Hydrochloric acid, and this 
    can burn through human flesh. Acids (and their direct rivals Alkalis also known as Bases) have 
    their strength and corrosivity measured by the pH scale; with 7 being completely neutral, 0 being 
    the most Acidic, and 14 being the most Alkaline. Concentrated Hydrochloric acid is typically 
    between pH 1.0 and 2.0, similar to battery acid which can corrode through steel.<sup><a href="http://www.industrytap.com/stomach-acid-can-dissolve-metal/34295">8</a></sup>  Hydrochloric 
    acid is a very dangerous substance that requires rigorous safety procedures to protect people 
    handling the chemical, even so there are still accidents that cause severe damage as shown in 
    the picture below.<sup><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/hydrochloric-acid">9</a></sup>
</p>

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="images\acid burn.jpg"></div>

<p>The question that follows is since the acid can severely damage to a person, how can the stomach 
    of the Spitter contain it without being eaten away? The answer for a regular human comes in two
     parts. Firstly the walls of the stomach secrete thick layers of protective mucus that, when it 
     reacts with any acid that tries to corrode through it, neutralizes it with trapped electrolytes 
     like HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>.<sup><a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-dont-our-digestive-ac/">10</a></sup> Secondly normal stomach acid is less concentrated 
     than. A drop of HCL in a litre of water wouldn’t damage your skin at all, a drop of water in a 
     litre of HLC would melt your hand to the bone if not dissolve that too. For the Spitter to 
     contain acid concentrated enough to burn targets the protective mucus on the walls would have to 
     be much thicker or made of a material that was less reactive with the acid.
</p>

<p>Based on the size of the pool of acid left once the ball impacts, the Spitter releases the entire 
    contents of their stomach with each spit. This is dangerous as those acids are required to 
    breakdown food, and based on the fact that the Spitter is able to spit the same sized ball every 
    15 seconds, also impossible due to the fact that stomach acid does not replenish at that speed 
    (otherwise conditions like Hypochlorhydria and Achlorhydria, medical conditions caused by having 
    a too little concentration of stomach acid, would not be of such severe concern).<sup><a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/hypochlorhydria">11</a></sup>
</p>

<p>The range a Spitter can spit and have the ball stay intact is also impossible. The Guinness World 
    Records website holds the furthest range a human has been able to spit a cherry stone at 33.6 
    metres<sup><a href="https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/cherry-stone-spitting-greatest-distance">12</a></sup> however a cherry stone is light and tiny in comparison. For an object only 
    the size of a table tennis ball the distance of the record lowers to 12.8 metres<sup><a href="https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/greatest-distance-to-spit-a-table-tennis-ball">13</a></sup>, 
    and that is still much smaller.
</p>

<p>The ball has a radius of approximately 0.1m and therefore a volume of 2.36x10<sup>-3</sup> cubic 
    metres or 2.36 litres. Modelling the density of the stomach acid as the same as water (1 litre 
    weighing 1kg), we get a mass of 2.36 kg. The average height of US females is about 1.62m<sup><a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/womens-health/average-height-for-women">14</a></sup>, 
    and because the Spitter typically fires straight forwards we can calculate the time it takes for 
    the ball to hit the ground using <b>Time = √[(2 x distance)/Acceleration]</b>. Acceleration due 
    to gravity is 9.81 metres per second squared therefore the time taken is equal to 0.57 seconds. 
    We can use that time to work out the velocity required for the ball to travel the 12.8 metre table 
    tennis ball record using <b>Speed = Distance/Time</b>. A speed of 22.3 metres per second or just 
    under 50 miles per hour. At that speed, air resistance would cause the ball of liquid to lose its 
    shape and become a splatter.
</p>

<p>A splatter instead of a ball would arguably be more dangerous as it makes it harder to avoid. But 
    the Spitter would still not be viable as, using <b>Force = (Mass x Velocity)/Time</b> and assuming 
    the force is applied once more in 0.1 seconds, the force required to spit is 525 Newtons which 
    would require unfeasibly strong neck muscles.
</p>

<p>One interesting real life equivalent is the Archer fish, that shoot water up to 10 feet into the 
    air to hunt insects. However the archer fish uses the water that is around them in abundance and 
    causes no harm to them whereas the Spitter uses a very dangerous acid that they have in short 
    supply.
</p>

<div class='blogarticlebreak'></div>
<h3>The Witch</h3>

<p>Witches are the other type of infected that appear to be only female and their visible mutations 
    are less grotesque than the Spitters but are no less scary; their fingers elongated into sharp, 
    blade-like claws. Something about this mutation causes the Witches to seem even more mentally 
    unstable than other infected types, as they are generally passive and are seemingly solitary and 
    always sobbing and weeping.
</p>

<p>If provoked by loud noises, bright lights, or a survivor stumbling into close proximity, they will 
    go into a fit of rage and chase the person who startled them until they lose the target or either 
    the target or Witch is dead. Despite the Witch infected looking fragile they are actually 
    overwhelmingly resilient, though flames are the most effective method of dealing with them. Their 
    sharpened claws provide one of the deadliest weapons of all infected, able to shear through flesh 
    like a hot knife through butter.
</p>

<p>The four distinguishing parts about the Witch infected are the lengthened claws, the deteriorated 
    mental state, the hyper-aggressive startling from light, sound, etc., and the resistance to 
    damage.
</p>

<p>The claws are viable and have real-life examples. Clawed dinosaurs like velociraptors and 
    allosaurs were capable of easily cleaving the flesh and skin of other dinosaurs, so the sharp 
    claws of the Witch would easily be able to apply the amount of force to cut into and through the 
    flesh of humans.
</p>

<p>The deteriorated mental state is surprisingly enough also plausible. While research is still 
    ongoing there are documented correlations between certain pathogens and certain mental illnesses. 
    A study in Denmark found “severe infections requiring hospitalizations” gave child and adolescent 
    patients a staggering 84% higher risk of forming mental illness; and even less severe ones that 
    could simply be treated with medicine increased the risk by 40%.<sup><a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/article-abstract/2716981">15</a></sup>
</p>

<p>An article by the former director of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Thomas Insel 
    also details growing evidence that children that were infected by the Streptococcal strain of 
    bacteria have risk of developing Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) and/or tic disorders that 
    onset almost overnight.<sup><a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/directors/thomas-insel/blog/2010/microbes-and-mental-illness.shtml">16</a></sup>
</p>

<p>Unfortunately, both of these cases only affect children and adolescents: however, it is not 
    impossible that such a trend couldn’t also exist for adults with a certain pathogen. But it might 
    not even degrade mental state anyway…
</p>

<p>The behaviour for noise and light, though seemingly a reaction of startling and a degraded mental 
    state as the game states, could instead be the triggering of an ambush; and the Witch could be an 
    ambush predator. This ambush mentality can be found often in nature and consists of three types; 
    concealment, traps, or aggressive mimicry. For the Witch, aggressive mimicry would be the most 
    accurate, working by using signals, behaviour, and sometimes partial camouflage to trick 
    potential prey into thinking the animal is a different species, for example the crab spider 
    species the Epicadus heterogaster which has an abdomen with features that allow it to reflect UV 
    signals in a way that tricks pollinating insects, the species’ prey, into thinking it is a flower. <sup><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-09456-y">17</a></sup> 
    The Witches may work as ambush predators mimicing mourning, distraught women tricking unknowing 
    people into approaching; and sound and light are nothing more than the signals the Witch looks for 
    before they spring the trap and attack. This also could mean that the pathogen hadn’t even 
    deteriorated the mental state of the Witch, just simply altered her behaviour.
</p>

<p>Stopping the Witch from being entirely plausible is their extreme durability. For the body to be 
    able to survive under continuous gunfire, it would have to be able to stop the bullets from 
    penetrating the skin, or at least force the bullet to expend its energy to do so. This sort of 
    natural armour does occur; the Peacock Mantis shrimp’s claws have armour capable of withstanding 
    4 gigapascals of pressure<sup><a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/notrocketscience/?p=7059">18</a></sup>, enough to survive a standard NATO 5.56x45mm round fired from 2 
    centimetres away; other underwater creatures have similar strong armours. However carapace armour 
    does not exist on the body of the Witch based on its appearance.
</p>

<p>The Witch infected could be an ambush predator, and there are many examples of how it could be 
    easily viable in real life. However, the in-game Witch’s extreme resilience to damage compared 
    to their appearance is simply not possible.
</p>

<div class='blogarticlebreak'></div>
<h3>So what if the green flu occurred?</h3>

<p>These infected could not exist in the forms that they are depicted as in Left 4 Dead; however that 
    does not mean that they could not exist in essence. So what if an outbreak actually occurred? What 
    if there was a green flu epidemic that spread through the world; creating Smokers that had their 
    tongues but just didn’t explode into smoke, Hunters that couldn’t leap great distances but worked 
    with less bulletproof Witches to ambush survivors, and Spitters that like Boomers were almost 
    suicide units that were made to spread the disease and then die. What would become of the world?
</p>

<p>How quickly could the infection spread? Within the Left 4 Dead canon, there are two main ways the 
    infection spreads. The first is as an airborne virus, this would allow it to spread quite rapidly 
    as it would both contaminate the air we breathe and surfaces we touch. The airborne vector would 
    be the main cause of infection early on due to the period between infection and the host becoming 
    a zombie.
</p>

<p>Yearly in the United States flus like the one that the green flu is disguised as (since it isn’t 
    really a flu but the government covered it up to try stop immediate panic), results in anywhere 
    from 9.3 million to 49 million illnesses.<sup><a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/influenza/facts-and-statistics#1">19</a></sup> Assuming the Green Flu infected that 
    general number during the average length of flu season (13 weeks) and that the infection took 
    several days to turn the infected into the crazed cannibals they are; the initial outbreaks 
    would cause hundreds of thousands to even millions of infected within 3-4 days of one another, 
    the typical amount of time you are the most contagious during with the flu.<sup><a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/influenza/facts-and-statistics#1">20</a></sup> This time 
    from infection to turning, called the “incubation period”, is incredibly important as the longer 
    it is, the harder it is to detect and stop the spread of the disease so the more people will be 
    infected before we even know anything is wrong.
</p>

<p>The other method of infection is through rabies-like transfer of fluids, be that saliva and blood 
    as is seen within the games or through the boomer bile or Spitter acid as some speculate. This 
    would become the predominant method during and after the initial outbreaks in major population 
    centres. The rate of infection via this method is harder to pin down.
</p>

<p>In the medieval times the plague was an incredibly infectious, incredibly deadly disease that 
    swept Europe killing vast swathes of the population. Infecting hundreds of millions and killing 
    just as many and the method of transmission was through fluid transfer from fleas. Fleas would 
    bite people to take in their blood, and the transfer would allow the pathogen to enter the 
    bloodstream and infect the host, just as the Green Flu would. We also know that the plague has no 
    issue surviving and spreading in modern population centres because of the recent outbreaks of it 
    in parts of the California state.
</p>

<div class='blogarticlebreak'></div>

<p>So how would the government be able to respond to such a massive outbreak? Unfortunately, it might 
    go a lot like the video games describe it. The United States (where the series and initial 
    outbreaks take place) has a military of 1.3 million active units and 800 thousand-odd reserve 
    soldiers<sup><a href="https://www.globalfirepower.com/country-military-strength-detail.asp?country_id=united-states-of-america">21</a></sup>; on top of its armed law enforcement and public militia, this makes it sound 
    like there would be enough armed people to take care of the infected. However that may not be the 
    case. Because of the nature of the issue, the US military would be limited by how much protective 
    gear – hazard suits, gas masks, etc – they could give their soldiers, they may have less soldiers 
    available due to those out at war or in training exercises, and their numbers would be further 
    dwindled by those already infected. The issue from there becomes deployment speed.
</p>

<p>The Green Flu would act like a guerrilla faction. Soldiers may be sleeper agents, infected 
    individuals not even knowing they are infected. Those with signs of infection could be false 
    positives, sowing paranoia into the populous and making people question who is safe or dangerous. 
    Initial outbreaks causing massive panic and taking the government some time to respond, sending 
    sections of their military to different major population centres to try contain it. However those 
    attempts would take some time to set up and ship out properly and safely and in the mean time 
    panic and infection would continue at high rates. Some of the less high population areas, small 
    towns and such, may not get any military aid at all as the government focuses on cities and would 
    fall into complete chaos and disarray.
</p>

<p>How would the military attempts go? At first they may be okay. In the first few days of the 
    infection the special infected would not have mutated into existence; leaving the military to 
    only have to deal with the hordes of common infected and any others that turned in whatever 
    evacuation or quarantine setups they had. But then the mutations would begin. Snipers would start 
    to get ambushed and cut to ribbons by Hunters, rescue teams shredded by Witches, armoured sections 
    and walls smashed and crushed by Tanks. Soon the situation may slip out of hand, prompting the 
    military to use more extreme tactics: air strikes, artillery bombardments, etc. In places where 
    things got so out of hand that a city was truly lost, this may end in Nuclear armaments being 
    deployed. And that is only accounting for the known forms of special infected from the games. 
    What would happen if there came a strain of infected that could fly, or have methods of killing 
    and infecting that were more potent than the special infected we know?
</p>

<p>Even if you killed the infected, they would still be a vector for the virus; bleeding and spreading 
    the virus further as they decomposed. The question becomes if there is anything at all that could 
    we do? Fire. Fire is an effective tool against the spread of diseases within corpses, killing 
    bacteria due to high temperatures. This helps not only stem the rate and risk of infection from 
    the Green Flu but also other diseases such as Tuberculosis.<sup><a href="https://www.who.int/diseasecontrol_emergencies/guidelines/risks/en/">22</a></sup> An example of modern use of mass 
    burning to combat disease is in 2001 where cattle was burned in mass quantities in the UK to 
    combat against the outbreak of Foot-and-Mouth disease. Mass burial is also effective, however it 
    is a slower method than just burning the bodies. The government efforts would have to prioritise 
    dealing with living infected and require a fast method to deal with the dead among other reasons, 
    fire becomes a very useful suggestion.
</p>

<p>Another reason fire would be a useful tool is because of how effective it is against the two most 
    dangerous infected types; the Witch and the Tank, the hardest to deal with, and advised to be 
    killed with fire. This means that fire would be not only very useful for combatting the spread of 
    the disease but combatting the infected themselves.<sup><a href="https://left4dead.fandom.com/wiki/The_Witch">23</a> <a href="https://left4dead.fandom.com/wiki/The_Tank">24</a></sup>
</p>

<p>Some may believe that despite its uses, the military would have a hard time deploying incendiary 
    weapons due to how it’s a war crime to use on people, with things like napalm and white phosphorus 
    being banned by the treaty against incendiary weaponry Protocol III. However that is a 
    misconception, incendiaries aren’t banned, much like guns aren’t banned in the UK, just heavily 
    restricted. The rules state that Incendiary weapons can be used so long as they either aren’t 
    used on civilian targets and aren’t used on military targets unless there is no less painful 
    means of dealing with them.<sup><a href="https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/customary-ihl/eng/docs/v1_rul_rule85">25</a></sup> On top of this weapons that have an incendiary component 
    that is not the main effect, such as tracers, armour penetrating ammunition, or other 
    combined-effect weapons as long as they aren’t intentionally used to cause suffering on human 
    targets, as their application is not as an incendiary weapon so can be used against the infection. 
    The United States also still only partly agrees to the banning of napalm with ex-president Barack 
    Obama having signed Protocol III only in 2009, but adding the stipulation that this treaty would 
    be ignored if the use of incendiary weapons and napalm could save civilian lives.<sup><a href="https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/applic/ihl/ihl.nsf/Notification.xsp?action=openDocument&documentId=3AB9E36D37F951ECC1257558003E6A3F">26</a></sup>

<p>The US government could use incendiary weapons such as the Mark 77 bomb if it were to save 
    civilian lives. Civilian use of flamethrowers would be also easier than expected due to how 
    commercial flamethrowers like Ion Production’s XM42 or Elon Musk’s infamous Boring Company 
    flamethrowers are legal in every US state barring California.<sup><a href="https://www.online-paralegal-programs.com/what-states-are-flamethrowers-legal-in/">27</a></sup>

<p>What would the outcome be? Would the world devolve into the state it shows in Left for Dead or 
    could humanity beat it back? The answer is highly speculative; but it is reasonable to assume 
    that it would be like a modern Plague. The plague would be dangerous enough to kill tens if not 
    hundreds of millions of people due to the initial number of infected, the killing potential of 
    the special infected, and the panic and paranoia. The death toll would be a billion to two 
    billion in a worst case scenario if the disease spread and had similar outbreaks in other 
    countries. But while the highly mutative, almost impossible to pin down green flu is as hard to 
    cure with our modern technology as the plague was for 14<sup>th</sup> century technology, with the Green 
    Flu we have more effective knowledge of how to stem spread of the disease and if nothing else we 
    have a definite enemy and lots of bullets to shoot. There would most certainly be survivors due 
    to the sheer ability of humanity to adapt and survive. As the saying goes, humanity always finds 
    a way.</p>
