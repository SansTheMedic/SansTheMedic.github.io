<p>In zombie bash, Zombies have invaded the planet in massive droves and it's up to you to survive and hold back their
    deadly bites for as long as possible and take as many with you as possible when your time finally comes. Zombie bash
    plays rather like a rhythm game where you have to memorise the patterns of the approaching enemies; however you don't
    always have to kill them. In fact, it is sometimes required to just duck away where the zombies can't get you.
</p>

<p>Zombie bash was made for the 2017 MS Paint Game Jam, the mission statement of which was to create a game that's art
    style and feel was similar to that of MS paint following the announcment that the program would no longer be supported
    by Microsoft.

<p>The zombies come from 4 places, ground left and right and platform left and right. There are actually two lanes despite
    the four directions. The first lane is bottom left and platform right, and the second is bottom right and platform left.
    Zombies on either path cannot damage you if you are on the platform of the other pathway, which allows you to be able to
    simply dodge some hordes that would be too great to fell with just your blade and revolver. This can create interesting
    gameplay with slight tactics to it where you have to think about whether you need to fight or just dodge away in situations
    (There is even one level that is built around that very idea).

<p>I designed the game, made the sprites and menu images, and developed the game; my dad co-developed, advised, and published it
    to the Itch.io; my younger brothers Tom and Seth made the level backgrounds, and my younger brother Fred playtested. we used
    unity to code as the engine for our game, coded it in C#, and made all the sprites and backgrounds in MS paint. We got the
    sounds and music from a royalty free sound library website. We also used JIRA and subversion to help us keep organised by
    setting specific tasks and making sure both our versions were up to date to ensure we didn't step on each other's toes.
    In total, Zombie bast landed in 5th place in the game jam over all, and got first place in the catagory of the MS paint feel.

<p>That being said there are still some minor problems with the game. For instance in the second level of the game, titled "school",
    which contains the tutorial for using the gun, we accidentally labelled the crouch button as [D], despite how it is actually [S].
    I'm not exactly sure how that got past testing, but none of us seemingly picked up on it sadly. Another thing we could have done
    better is the sort of "level prestige" system we did to take our 25 scripted levels and loop them. See, after you finished the 25th
    and "final" level, Hell, you would continue back at level 1, however the number of zombies were doubled and the second set came at
    a slight time offset from the first. We'll call this "prestiging" So example for after you completed hell to get to prestige 1, the 
    next level would be level one, but for each of the four zombies that spawned you would get a second one spawn at a slight offset 
    from the first, meaning there were 8 in total; and if you completed hell twice (prestige 2) then the next level would have 12 zombies. 
    However, that IF for getting to prestige 2 is a big one, as prestige 1 is impossible. Many of the levels, such as the level "sewers",
    have increcibly tight timings that the slight offset of the second set makes simply impossible. Really the better option in hindsight
    would be to have had the level sets just repeat; meaning the patterns wouldn't have gotten "harder", but you would have to keep up
    the patterns for longer. That being said even that solution has issues as it would be the sort of difficulty increase that scaling up
    an enemy's health is; not really making them harder but just more of a slog and more frustrating...
