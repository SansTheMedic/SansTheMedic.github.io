<p>Sector 104 was an interesting experience, as we had a lot of work to do from, well, from even before the game jam actually started.
    We were doing multiple new things at the time, both learning a new library in the form of SDL and me using C++ for the first time and
    with dad not having used it for years upon years. This, on top of how I was preparing to take the CTMUA Cambridge entrance exam made
    this a real undertaking.
</p>

<p>I'd say this game jam was the most difficult of them all, simply because of the sheer amount of work we had ahead of us. That was partly
    the reason we decided to make such a simple game; since it was going to be such a workload to get the C++ and SDL figured out anyway. My
    dad mostly worked on the SDL stuff though I also learned how it worked and got a little experience in it to create the audio manager on
    the game. I on the other hand mostly worked on the actual gameplay side, creating the classes for the enemies. Dad had also worked on a
    good portion of gameplay though, such as the stations and the base class for the weapon objects.

<p>The game was quite fun to create, minus the more difficult issues that popped up such as how the missiles were incapable of targetting
    enemies directly beneath it. The only point where I felt particularly drained was during the designing and timing of the levels. It's
    also the one point where I feel like I fell short of what could have been done. Originally we wanted it to make the game a 30 minute
    long experience however in reality it was only made to be about 10 minutes. Perhaps more enemy types would have helped me during the
    process (I did the timings of enemies myself), or more time to do it (the level designing was done on the last day of the jam): but
    as it is the game is shorter than we wanted...
</p>

<p>Another issue is that of art. This wasn't an issue caused by me, since the only sprite I actually made myself was the sprite for the
    lasers for the queen enemy (the queen's attack needed it's own class and so needed a seperate sprite). The sprites were mostly done
    by my brothers Tom and Seth. It's not the best, but it works well enough.
</p>

<p>All the same, me and my dad both believe that it'd be possible to go back to this game, polish it up, fix some of the issues, pay some
    proper artists for sprites, and extend the game with maybe some other classes; and we could quite probably sell it on steam. All in all
    this was a fun and useful experience, though it didn't exactly leave much holiday for me, heh.
