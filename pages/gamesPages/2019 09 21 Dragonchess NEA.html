<h3>This was originally going to be done as my computer science NEA for GCSE, however sadly due to limited time and the game's complexity, it had to be abandoned.</h3>

<p>Gary Gygax is the co-creator of the hit pen and paper RPG, Dungeons and Dragons (D&D). It's fame and reputation are well 
    known across the world, but what is less known are the numerous official D&D magazines. In one issue 100 of the Dragon
    Magazine, one of the 2 major ones; Gary Gygax laid out over 7 pages the official ruleset for Dragonchess.

<p>15 unit types, 84 total pieces, 3 seperate boards; dragonchess was a beast of a game to build and play. And I'm not
    exactly talking for the developers when it comes to the building. The players would have to be the ones to make the
    game so they could play it. Because Dragonchess was unveiled in Dragon Magazine, it did not come with any parts of an
    actual board or pieces; nor were such things ever released; meaning players would have to construct them on their own.
    That, in my personal oppinion, is a big reason why Dragonchess sort of faded into obscurity and definitely never
    took off, with the only real mention of it within mainstream D&D playerbase being a very simple, very useless object
    that can be "played", in honestly the world's loosest sense of the world.
</p>

<p>Honestly I feel that if the internet had been closer back in 1985 (When Dragon Magazine #100 was published) to what it
    is now, Dragonchess would have had a good chance to take off from people creating online versions that would allow
    people to not have to build the board and pieces physically themselves; but alas it was not the case at the time and as
    such there never was a chance for the poor chess variant.
</p>

<p>There is only ONE version of digital dragonchess whatsoever that I could find is a <a href="http://dragonchess.sourceforge.net/index.html">small downloadable version</a> that hasn't
    been touched since early in <i>2003</i>, which is okay but absolutely not very good. In fact, not only is that the only
    digital dragonchess around but if you search dragonchess on the internet the first actual game you get is a completely
    different, non-D&D related, and frankly rather ugly and boring looking game by the same name.

<p>So in the end, there is no good way to play this cool game. My hope is to fix that.</p>

<p>That's why, for my Computer Science A-level NEA task, I decided to work on creating my own browser based online Dragonchess
    service. Bringing the game to life on the internet would be the thing that the game really deserved honestly, since it
    is a genuinely fun experience from the few games I've played of it. A bit confusing with all of the rules sure, but
    still fun.
</p>

<p>I plan for the service to offer a large number of lobbies with special 3 word combination codes as the passwords for the
    lobby that players can send to a friend to join; allow the players to play the game securely and use systems on the
    server side to ensure players don't cheat. The game should also store stat scores for certain things like games played
    and wins.
</p>

<p>The server will ONLY store the user's Username, Email, and Hash, in order to ensure the players' accounts are protected
    and to comply with the Data Protection Act of 1998. The Email is stored in order to give players a way to access their
    account if they forget their password.
</p>

<p>The Object relationships of the game should look something like this:</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="images\gamesImages\NEA Object relationships chart.png" width="50%" height="auto">
</div>

<p>And the database relationships, which is much simpler, should look like this:</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="images\gamesImages\NEA database relationship chart.png">
</div>

<p>The board of the game is held in 4 quadrants. The top right one is the sky board, bottom left is land, bottom right is
    the underground/underdark/whatever it is to be called, and the top right contains a move history. Move history is not
    planned to be saved in the initial goals, but if I have time in the project I will try to do so as a stretch goal.
</p>

<p>Other stretch goals for if I complete the main system will include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Quick play system for those of us who have no friends</li>
    <li>Global/reigonal chat for players to talk to one another</li>
    <li>Client chosen skins for their pieces so they can play the armies they want</li>
    <li>Board editor so players can make fun new scenarios to play against their friends with, recreate other matches, or
        just fill the board with dragons and meme
    </li>
    <li>Spectators so games can be watched by other friends. This could possibly be extended into long lasting lobbies where
        multiple players can all join and will be able to play in turns and watch (think Smash Bros Ultimate)
    </li>
</ul>
