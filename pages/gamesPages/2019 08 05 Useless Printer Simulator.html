<p>This game is amazing and I love it, but at the same time it's amazing because of how horrible it is and I love it because
    it's such an anti-game. It plays a lot like a clicker game but while clicker games are supposed to be idle distraction,
    Printer sim is something so boring it's what you'd try to find distraction from. The thing is, though, that's the point.
</p>

<p>From the very start, the goal for the game was to encapsulate the feeling of agonizing slowness and constant delays of
    IRL printing, always needing to load more paper and being out of toner that wouldn't even need to be used. I feel like
    we accomplished that well. Even with such a small amount of stuff to do due to the limited time we (me and my dad) had 
    to make this, it's practically 24 hours of content at least and very much meeting the aesthetic.

<p>We originally started using Unity for the game, however after a few hours we changed gears and used Windows Forms
    instead as it was easier to code for. We used Visual Studio to code, a few free sound websites for the sounds,
    and both Aesprite and piskel for the artwork. As for utility stuff we used JIRA for agile development and Subversion
    for version control. I did most of the coding as well as the artwork, while my dad did the last bits of coding, the
    unit tests, and published the submission for the jam.
</p>

<p>Balancing ended up being a real struggle and even once we submitted we eventually realized that we had got it a little
    off; since after a while the resources (wood, paper, toner, and oil) were increasing at a rate that made it impossible
    to run out of them, though you would run out in the early game. We also, after the submission deadline had closed, came
    up with both a solution/extra feature where you could directly sell those resources for prints (the main currency) at
    a rate that was less efficient than just using those resources for prints, or perhaps a feature where when you maxxed out
    some of the upgrades that were causing the mass increase rate of the resources, you'd get new upgrades for your Printer
    which would make you get even more prints at a time but also drastically increase the amount of resource used.

<p>At the moment we're still waiting on the ranking as the rating deadline still hasn't quite been hit just yet as
    of the time of writing, but I'm hopeful we did well!
