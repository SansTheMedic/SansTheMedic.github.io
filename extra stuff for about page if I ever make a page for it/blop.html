<p>I was diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome in Year 5, though I had been going through the diagnosis process since year 1. It has played a large part in who I am in my opinion, as I attribute it largly to my intelligence and believe that while it is not the sole
    reason, it is a good portion of why I am in the position I am academically. I don't really remember much of my time in primary school, other than the fact that I never really had any real friends and that I very much enjoyed my roles in the two school plays.
    Really, it was Secondary school that's definied who I am in the real world. It's where I've met all my real life friends, where I learned my love for Magic the Gathering, where I got my first taste of Dungeouns and Dragons, and where I was able to start really
    moving into getting myself able to pursue my dream of games design.
</p>
<p>However, while I do have a good portion of my self identity formed from the real world: an equal or perhaps even greater part has come from the online world. Online, I've been able to meet people who share my interests much more than the people at school (I doubt
    that anyone there plays some of the games I do other than those I've recommended them to); and where I have been able to let my creative tendencies fly and define not only myself but my ideas. I owe a lot to my online friends, both the newer ones that I roleplay
    with and the older ones that I've been with for years now and still joke around and have fun with; and by extension I owe just as much to the internet itself, computers themselves, and computer science as a whole.
</p>
<p>In gaming, I have always enjoyed more casual games, or at least games that give you the ability to be casual. Minecraft and Team Fortress 2 are not serious games where you are having to be 100% competetive 100% of the time, they're silly and casual games you
    can just open and play for a little bit to relax and have fun. Xcom 2 is a bit more of a tense, brain busting game at times, but I play on rookie difficulty with some mods to reduce stress and make the game easier so it's not exactly like I am very non-casual
    with that game either. I've also always thought that a game that supports modding is a game that will do better, simply due to the fact that the consumer will be able to make just as much good content as the developer, and therefore extend the life of the product
</p>
<p>One thing I have always wanted to use games development to do is fully realize and bring out the stuff I've used for a good portion of my RP, my Intelectual Property or IP purely for lack of a better term for it. I've been working on and nursing it for a very
    long time; creating, altering, and sometimes removing characters and groups and items to really flesh it out. It's honestly always been a fun challenge to fine tune everyone and everything to be not only balanced among each other, but be able to be translated into
    games in a way that wouldn't be too complex and also interesting enough that people would enjoy them.I intend to some day make an archive of it to give something of a wiki of all of the lore, characters, stories, and everything else related to my IP; in a similar 
    vein to how the SCP fandom has done.
</p>
<p>In the past, when I've written assessments and scripts where I haven't had to stay at least relatively formal; I've always taken great inspiration from youtube creators like Shoddycast's The Science! series, UpIsNotJump's videos, SsethTzeentach's game reviews, and Game
    Theory's... Well, Game Theory series. I've always thought that there's not really any point to giving a presentation or writing an assessment that's supposed to allow people to learn something if it's so boring they zone out and don't learn anything and that
    is why these creators and how they turn presentation into performance, entertaining people while they simultaneously educate them whether it's on interesting science or simply what a game is about, has so greatly inspired my personal style. That being said, it's 
    hard to show this style in formal things like a portfolio because these styles are a little too casual for it.
</p>

<h2>What I get up to in my day to day</h2>
<p>There have always been a lot of things that have captured my interest and taken up my time, especially as I get older and there become more and more things I want to do. One of the main things is most certainly Roleplay, or RP, however. I can't quite remember
    the age I first started doing RP, but I remember it was in the online website for Scratch, the drag and drop... I hesitate to call programming language because it feels like not quite the right word really... To be honest though, that doesn't matter much because
    I don't think I have even one idea from back then that I still use and hasn't been very heavily altered. More recently the RP I have done has been on two sites mainly; RPforums.net and Discord. RPforums only really contains one RP that I'm actively part of; but it
    is a big one so I think that's justifiable. The RP in question is Super Robot Wars, Paradox Cascade; a very very big RP that's based on the Super Robot Wars franchise but contains a whole smorgasbord of other IPs thanks to it's gimick of always involving crossovers.
    In that RP I play as a few groups; one most notably of which being both Griffon and Kryuger {G&K} as well as Sangvis Ferri {SF} from the franchise Girls Frontline {GFL}, the reason of which being I know the most about GFL out of the group. For anyone that wishes
    to read Paradox Cascade and see for yourself the... interesting show it is, you can find it <a href="http://www.rp-forums.net/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=11126">here</a>. As for discord, I do quite a few RPs on it though most are in private 1 on 1 servers or Direct Messaging
    so sadly I cannot easily let you see those. All the same, discord is where I much more am able to show my IP off and the RPs there have really shaped out many of the characters, notably Sam Shepard, the closest there is to a self-insert character due to him being
    my avatar for many of the RPs.
</p>

<p>On top of ropeplay, I oft play video games. One of the games I play the most recently is Girl's Frontline, or GFL, a mobile gatcha game by the developers MICA team. GFL sucks up a lot of my free time as it's a very grindy beast of a game; but I don't mind much as while
    the story is a bit dark for my liking - not massively big a fan or dark and gritty stories laden with PTSD and stuff - I find the gameplay more often than not to be relaxing and I greatly enjoy the characters and the community. Other game I very much enjoy but due to
    GFL do not play all too often include Team Fortress 2, which I view as one of the greatest games of all time for numerous reasons; Xcom 2, which has extremely entertaining gameplay though sadly it suffers in the late game due to not ever throwing enough of a twist to
    the gameplay; and Tom Clancey's Ghost Recon Wildlands, which I don't love for it's gameplay or story but simply because of how utterly gorgeous is can look in the right place at the right time with the right weather. Seriously, Wildlands have some of the prettiest
    water physics I've seen in a game of it's sort in a while.
